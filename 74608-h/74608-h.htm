</div>

<p>Since the murder of King Carlos and of the Crown Prince
Luis Felipe on the 1st of February, 1908, Portugal has been in
the limelight. A swarm of writers have descended like locusts
on the land, and the printing-presses of Europe have groaned
beneath the mass of matter concerning this unfortunate
country. Yet most often the matter has been necessarily
superficial, and a few outstanding features, a murder, a
revolution, the methods of a secret society, have laid hold on
public attention. The Portuguese is, therefore, apt to be
regarded less as a poetical dreamer, heir of the glories of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, than as a political schemer,
with a pistol in one pocket and a bomb in another. And
since in the matter of political disturbances the end is not
yet, and a strident minority is likely for some years to come
to impose itself in Portugal and attempt to impose itself on
public opinion abroad, crying out that all criticism of it springs
from hatred of Portugal, it is of importance to distinguish
between this minority of misguided, unscrupulous and half-educated
persons, and the true people of Portugal. We do
not usually mistake a little yellow froth on the surface for the
sea, and only the ignorant will saddle the Portuguese people
with the words and deeds of a political party with which
it has no connection whatever, not even that of the vote.
Great Britain has everything to gain from a better understanding
of a people with which she has so many dealings,
and which is in itself so extraordinarily interesting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
attractive. Prejudices rather easily formed against it vanish
in the light of better knowledge. In intellectual matters at
present Portugal turns almost exclusively to France, but
there is no reason why the business connection between
Great Britain and Portugal should not lead to closer ties.
A needful preliminary is that Englishmen should be at pains
to learn something more of her ancient ally than is manifested
in its politics, often as representative of Heligoland or Honolulu
as of Portugal.</p>

<h1>Portugal of the Portuguese</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The People.</div>

<p>Too many judge the character of the Portuguese from a
hasty study of what Beckford nearly a century ago impolitely
called the Lisbon <i>canaille</i>. The life of the
Portuguese in a political and literary (written
literature) sense is concentrated in Lisbon,
but outside this narrow circle exists the Portuguese people
proper, to the foreigner almost an unknown quantity, taking
no concern for the latest political party formed or the latest
volume of second-rate verse published, yet constituting in
its strength or weakness the political future of Portugal and
containing within itself a whole literature of prose and poetry,
legend and song. In some measure those who know the Irish
peasant know the Portuguese, and those who know the Irish
will realise from this comparison what a delightful mine of
interest is here to hand. Indeed, if you take the Irish peasantry,
add hot sun, a spice of the East, and perhaps something
of the negro’s vanity and slight hold on life, you have the
Portuguese. The quick intelligence, the dreaming melancholy,
the slyness and love of intrigue, the wit and imagination
are here, and the power of expression in words. Generosity,
too, and habits as unpractical as could be desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Patriotism.</div>

<p>The politician in Portugal who looks at the statistics, and,
seeing that 75 per cent. of this people are illiterate, shrugs his

population hard-working, vigorous, and intelligent, increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
fairly rapidly, content with little, not willingly learning to read
or write, but in its own way eagerly patriotic, each loving
Portugal as represented by his own town or village or farm,
though he may not have grasped the latest shades of humanity,
fraternity, or irreligion.</p>

<p class="noindent">From the earliest times the inhabitants of this western strip
of the Iberian peninsula had shown themselves capable of
heroic deeds and at the same time impressionable, open to
new ideas and foreign influences, more ready to co-operate
with the French and English than with their inland neighbours
the Castilians. Had the characters of these two neighbours
been less incompatible, Portugal might have come to recognise
the hegemony of Castille, as sooner or later did all the other
regions of the Peninsula, some of which were separated from
the central plains by natural barriers more difficult than was
Portugal. But to the Portuguese the Castilian too often was
and is a stranger and an enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Manoel the Fortunate.</div>

<p>As the power of Castille grew, Portugal called in a new
world to redress the balance of the old. Unfortunately in
reaching out for this support Portugal fatally
overstrained her strength, and the brilliant
reign (1495-1521) of King Manoel I (“that
great, fortunate, and only Emanuel of
Portugall,” Sir Peter Wyche called him) resembled the
Cid’s famous coffers, all crimson and golden without, but
containing more sand than gold. Those who look at the
bedraggled coffer hanging in Burgos Cathedral wonder how
it can have deceived the two Jews, and those who see the
present somewhat penniless and forlorn condition of Portugal
are apt to forget that it was once a great world-empire.
Before Portugal became that we have glimpses of the Portuguese
as a contented people, fond of song and dance, a pipe
and drum at every door, living rustic, idyllic lives as cultivators<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of the soil in a “land abounding in meat and drink,
<i>terra de vyandas e beveres muyto avondosa</i>” (fifteenth
century).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discovery of the Indies.</div>

<p>But the discoveries and conquests followed, the magic of
the sea, the mystery of the East wove a spell over the imagination
of the Portuguese, the country was
drained of men, devastated by plague and
famine. Lisbon and the East absorbed
energies hitherto given to the soil. Portugal, moreover, was
doomed to share Spain’s losses during the period 1580-1640,
and later was ravaged by frequent civil wars. In fine one
might expect to find a dwindling miserable population, dying
out from sheer exhaustion. But this would be very far from
being a true statement of the case. Portugal is only lying
fallow. There are reserves of health and energy, especially
in the north, in the sturdy peasants of Beira and Minho.
Politically it is only a potential strength, and the real people
of Portugal has never yet come into its own, although it was
on the point of doing so at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
It was not allowed to develop naturally after the first
third of that great century. Even to-day there are said to
be certain politicians who would dress it up in a suit of ready-made
clothes which has caught their fancy in some shop
window when they were on a visit to Paris. The Portuguese
people deserves better than that, and if it can be given a
national government, and a national policy and ideals, it may
yet surprise Europe. It is a question of encouraging the
indigenous side of Portuguese civilisation—in language,
literature, dress, legislation, drama, cookery, in everything—which
since the sixteenth century has been set aside for the
imported foreign-erudite; to develop as it were the Saxon
element at the expense of the Norman. The people have
succeeded in keeping many of their old and excellent customs—but
by the skin of their teeth now—as they have their
own names for many of the Lisbon streets and their own words
side by side with those of learned origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign Ingredients.</div>

<p>But in order to become acquainted with the Portuguese
people it is necessary to go far afield, to the remote villages
of Alemtejo or Minho or of the Serra da
Estrella, and, the means of doing this being
often primitive or non-existent, the traveller
contents himself with swift generalities derived from observation
of the inhabitants of the towns, precisely, that is, where
the Portuguese most displays his weaknesses and where the
population is most mixed. Reclus considered the Portuguese
“<i>très fortement croisés de nègres</i>,” and other foreign observers
have denied the existence of a Portuguese nationality, dismissing
it as a mere <i>pot pourri</i> of many races. If this is an
exaggeration, it cannot be denied that the many peaceful or
warrior invaders—Phoenician, Celt, Carthaginian, Greek or
Goth—attracted by this lovely land from age to age, and the
numerous slaves imported from Portugal’s overseas dominions
have contributed to form a mixed population, especially in
and around Lisbon. At Lisbon many persons evidently
have negro blood in their veins, and others are of Jewish
descent. Sobieski, the Polish traveller, wrote in 1611:
“There are in Portugal very many Jews, so many that various
houses have a Jewish origin. Although they have burnt and
expelled them, many live hidden among the Portuguese.”
This was 114 years after the expulsion of the Jews from
Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Provinces.</div>

<p>But Lisbon is a country in itself, divorced in many ways
from the rest of Portugal. The Portuguese provinces present
many differences of character among their
inhabitants, from the lively chattering <i>algarvio</i>
in the south to the duller, quietly poetical
and dreamy <i>minhoto</i> on the border of Galicia, unfairly
described by Oliveira Martins as “without elevation of spirit,
dense, the Dutch of Portugal,” the fervent, hardy <i>beirão</i>
mountaineer or the stolid farmers of Alemtejo.</p>

<p>Taking the character of the Portuguese as a whole, its main
feature seems to be vagueness. Their minds are not inductive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">General Character.</div>

<p>They think in generalities and abstractions, and their
deductions often have a closer relation to these than to the
facts of life. No doubt the dreamy climate
(King Duarte in the fifteenth century noted
the effect of climate on character), the misty
blue skies and wide sea horizons have exercised as much
influence on the character of the inhabitants as the many
foreign ingredients, the uncertain land boundaries, the fear
of attacks from the sea, the indefinite dangers of earthquake
and plague. Everywhere in Portugal is this lack of precision
evident, in the fondness for abstractions and unsubstantial
grandeur, the counting in <i>réis</i> (most transactions continue
to be made in <i>réis</i>, which though apparently clumsy is really
simpler than the new system of <i>centavos</i>—10 <i>réis</i>—and
<i>escudos</i>—1,000 <i>réis</i>), the love of the lottery, the perpetual
tendency to exaggerate, the inexhaustible and vague good-nature
which some more direct minds find so trying, the facile
criticism which encourages the existence of too many poets,
politicians and other nonentities, the absence of discipline,
the belief in the efficacy of words and rhetoric, the idle expectation
of better things, the <i>sebastianismo</i> which looks for the
return of the ill-fated king—a later Arthur—“on a morning
of thick mist”—the universal cult of undefined melancholy
and <i>saudade</i>. The French saying, “<i>Les portugais sont toujours
gais</i>,” should be rendered—</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Saudade.”</div>

<p>None but a nation with a beautiful land and delightful
climate could be so sad. Less favoured peoples are fain to
be content with what they can get, and, in
their necessary efforts to obtain something,
often obtain much. The Portuguese, living
in a land where it is possible to support life on almost nothing,
has little incentive to effort. Moreover, the Portuguese turns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
his imagination to the ideal, and comparing it with the real,
is saddened. His pessimism is essentially that of the idealist:
disillusion. He wishes for all or nothing, aims at a million
and misses an unit, whereas men more practical with less
intelligence it may be, and certainly less imagination, set
themselves to the work before them, and prosper. But it
must not be thought that, because the Portuguese cultivates
a gentle melancholy, he has a poor heart that never rejoices.
His sadness is often as superficial as the Englishman’s impassivity.
He is, generally, far too intelligent to find life ever
dull, or if he yields to <i>ennui</i> it is of the gorgeous philosophical
kind which takes a subtle pleasure in saying that “Vanity,
vanity, all is vanity.” As a rule, his sense of ridicule on the
one hand and his nervous self-consciousness on the other
make of life for him a perpetual feast of little comedies and
tragedies. But in practical matters, failing to realise his ideal,
he does not attempt to idealise the real, but views it with
laughter or disdain. The ideal is usually vague and set apart
from practical life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humanity.</div>

<p>Thus the humanity of the Portuguese is real, they have no
love of violence or bloodshed, but it is a state of mind rather
than a course of action, and can be curiously
combined with cruel persecutions in practice.
The expulsion of the Jews came to Portugal
from Spain, and it is difficult to believe that the Portuguese
people ever viewed the Inquisition fires in the <i>Rocio</i> with
anything but horror. But Vasco da Gama, Affonso
d’Albuquerque, Dom João de Castro and other Portuguese
in the East perpetrated cruelties as terrible as any practised
by the Inquisition. It was the habit of the early discoverers
to seize a few natives and, if they desired information, put
them to the torture. For sheer callousness the following deed
recorded of Vasco da Gama is remarkable (the date might
almost be 1915): “Namen wi een scip van Mecha daer waren
in drie hondert mannē en̄ tachtich en̄ veel vrouwen en̄ kinderen.
En̄ wi namen daar wt wel xii. dusent ducaten en̄ noch wel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
x. dusent an comanscap. En̄ wi verbranden dat scip en̄ al
dat volc te pulwer den tersten dach in October.” (That is:
Having captured a peaceful trading ship from Mecca, and
taken thereout the ducats and merchandise, the Portuguese
under Vasco da Gama blew up the ship with 380 men and
many women and children in her.) The Flemish sailor
chronicles the fact with more directness than would have
marked a Portuguese account. What is so striking is that the
dreamy humanity of the Portuguese does not desert him in
such an event. To take a recent instance—the murder of
Lieutenant Soares in Lisbon—no foreigner could ever forget
the gentle good-nature of the assassins, apparently <i>bonhommes</i>
and affable, nor the indifference and equanimity of the small
crowd that collected. Few Portuguese would consider Stevenson
anything but a pagan when he exclaims, at the idea of
loving all men: “God save me from such irreligion!”
Such directness is foreign to their temperament. They would
understand better the cry of the Canadian poet, Émile Nelligan,
“<i>J’ai voulu tout aimer et je suis malheureux</i>,” or Corneille’s
strange recommendation, “<i>Aimez-les toutes</i> (all women) <i>en
Dieu</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women.</div>

<p>The position of women in Portugal is another instance of
vague ideals. Woman is set on a pedestal, but women are
not always treated with consideration, and
in some parts of the country are little better
than slaves. Over and over again you will
meet a man and a woman, husband and wife, perhaps, the
man in lordly fashion carrying a small parcel or nothing at
all, the woman bowing under a huge load. No one thinks of
protesting against this, it passes without notice, nor has the
Republican Parliament, which has shown itself copious in
legislation, bestirred itself to introduce a bill dealing with the
position of women, although it has denied them the right to
vote. The peasant women continue to do twice the work of
the men, and to receive half the wages. Frei João dos Santos
at the beginning of the seventeenth century noted (<i>Ethiopia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Oriental</i>, 1609) that it was “as natural for Kaffir women to
work in the fields as to the women of Minho to spin,” but at
the present day it is the women in Portugal who do a heavy
part of out-of-door work. To their semi-slavery and Moorish
toil may perhaps be ascribed partly the fact that the women
in Portugal are less graceful and good-looking than the men.
On the other hand, Portuguese women of all classes often display
a common sense and strength and firmness of character
to a greater degree than do the men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberty.</div>

<p>Another good instance of the gulf between the ideal and
the real is to be found in the conception and the practice of
liberty. Abstract Liberty with a great L
goes to the head of the Portuguese like wine,
and in its name they have effected many a
revolution and committed many a crime. In practice it
can still be used, as two thousand years ago, “for a cloak of
maliciousness.” “Luminous in its virginal essence rises the
beneficent aspiration of a <i>régime</i> of liberty.” No doubt these
celebrated words of Dr. Theophilo Braga on the occasion of
the proclamation of the Republic were sincere, in so far as
words so abstract can have any concrete quality, but their
vagueness was characteristic and ominous. Equally indefinite
had been the poet Snr. Guerra Junqueiro’s description
of the future Republic in 1897. The Republic was to be
“a high road towards a new formula of civilisation.” Such
phrases, hollow and resounding like an empty barrel, have an
immense success in Portuguese politics.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus03" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WOMEN AT WORK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Business Capacity.</div>

<p>But the same vagueness pervades business. In business
the Portuguese appears incurably careless and combines with
this fault the most meticulous scruples. The
result is too often delay and confusion. There
as in other matters the Portuguese shows a
genius for setting himself in the wrong, his real ability is
eclipsed by superficial errors, the mistakes in estimates or
accounts are not always in his favour, and the unscrupulous
can easily take advantage of his hesitations and candour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
The personal element is always present, and vanity, together
with much real delicacy of feeling, enters into business matters.
A fact this which Englishmen dealing with Portuguese have
been slower to recognise in the past than other nations. Moreover
the Portuguese is harassed out of his wits by the details
of business, he likes a good lump sum down rather than much
larger but gradual profits, he goes for the pounds and leaves
the pennies to look after themselves. If he sees the advantage
of an enterprise, he rarely combines with this intelligence the
necessary perseverance and force of character to carry it
through. Yet here as always the Portuguese shows a marvellous
inclination to fritter away his energies in matters of the
minutest interest and minor importance, an inability to omit,
to leave off. They either have no method or a method so
minutely conceived that it is almost certain to break down
in practice. Portuguese scholarship sometimes vies with
German in unprofitable minuteness. For instance, Alexandre
Herculano, the historian, wrote a few fine poems: one of his
Portuguese critics has taken the trouble to ascertain the number
of verses (6,800) contained in all his original poems and
translations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>In religion, again, the same vagueness. Many Portuguese
prefer an undefined pantheism and a mystic love of Nature
or Humanity to dogmatic beliefs. The
ostentatious art of Roman Catholic ceremonies
and the exact precision of Protestant
services are both in a sense congenial to them, the former
appealing to their fondness for pomp and show, the latter to
their quiet thoughtfulness. But neither the one nor the other
affects them with sufficient force to fasten upon their minds a
fanaticism which is foreign to dreamy and comfortable natures.
The Roman Catholic religion exercises a greater influence on
the dramatic character of the Spanish than on the essentially
lyrical and idyllic nature of the Portuguese. Nor do the latter
show any marked enthusiasm for Protestantism, although the
number of Protestants is certainly larger than it is in Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Perhaps it is too clear and reasonable for them. They require
vagueness and mystery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrasts.</div>

<p>The character of a Portuguese is much more rarely than
that of a Spaniard all of one piece. The Spaniard’s, clear-cut
and angular, admits less readily of contrasts
and contradictions, whereas the very vagueness
of the Portuguese enables it to combine
opposing elements. Certainly, at least, there would seem to
be many puzzling inconsistencies in the character of the
Portuguese people. For they are like a quiet stream with
sudden falls. They are fatalists, but with moments of heroic
rebellion and effort, apathetic, with bursts of energy in private
and revolution in public life; kindly and docile, yet with
outbreaks of harshness and arrogance, indifferent yet with
fugitive enthusiasms and a real love of progress and change.
They are mystic and poetical with intervals of intense utilitarianism,
erratically practical, falling from idle dreams to a
keen relish for immediate profit. They combine vanity with
diffidence and pessimism; <i>naïveté</i>, which makes them the
butt of Spanish stories, with slyness, whereby they have their
revenge; indolence with love of sport and adventure; respect
for the feelings of others with fondness for satire, sarcasm, and
ridicule. They go easily from heights of rapture to depths of
melancholy and suicidal despair, from frank trustfulness to
extremes of suspicion and intrigue, and their dreamy thoughtfulness
passes at rare intervals to explosions of passion and
abuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Real and the Ideal.</div>

<p>The fact is that both in life and literature they are incorrigibly
romantic, and when they turn from their romantic
dreams to reality they are peculiarly exposed
to the danger of not considering it worth an
effort. They let things be, they easily persuade
themselves that things must be as they are, or that
they are as they in words imagine them; and so in their
<i>saudade</i> for some impossible ideal they sink into <i>desleixo</i> and
drift (<i>deixarse-ir</i>, <i>deixarse-estar</i>). Or the Portuguese will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
continue to live in his romanticism and ignore reality altogether;
his vanity helps him to ignore it; he will wear cheap
and garish chains and rings and trinkets and imagine himself
rich, he will eke out the picture by the help of his quick
imagination and ever-ready flow of words, heaping rhetoric
and exaggeration, and in his vagueness drifting ere he is
aware into falsehood. Then, if his efforts to impose the
picture of his imagining on others at his own valuation fail,
he will feel hurt by their brutal directness, their incapacity
to see that a mere string of words may move mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Desleixo.”</div>

<p>They are taxed with laziness, but it should at least be
observed that the laziness is not due to lack of energy, but
rather to the conviction that “it is not worth
while”—<i>desleixo</i>. When a thing does appear
to be worth while the <i>desleixo</i> disappears like
a cast-off mask. The amount of work achieved, for instance,
by some Portuguese politicians or men-of-letters is
extraordinarily large.</p>

<p>More serious is the accusation that they do not know what
the word justice means, hate or love, acquit or condemn,
fawn or bully, persecute or place on a pinnacle as occasion
offers, and lose all sense of fair play in their vindictiveness.
But after all it is the attraction of the Latin temperament
that it is quick and impulsive, even if it therefore rarely attains
that impartial justice which is all-important for the ruling
of an Empire, but the absence of which certainly adds a
picturesque and unforeseen element to life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude to Foreigners.</div>

<p>Unhappily the Portuguese delicacy often meets with
rougher manners in foreigners and shrinks as from a rebuff.
The Portuguese himself is excessively sensitive
and he will go out of his way and sacrifice
his own comfort and indolence in order not
to hurt the feelings of others, perhaps in some trifling matter
of which the person thus contemplated, especially if he is a
foreigner, remains serenely unaware. The Portuguese do
not know how to treat foreigners. This may seem a strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
statement to those who have visited Portugal and experienced
the kindness and courtesy of high and low on all sides. But
they make too great a difference between themselves and
foreigners, and have an almost morbid desire to stand well
in the eyes of the stranger, to appear civilised and <i>bien élevés</i>.
On one occasion when a spirited affray was proceeding in the
<i>Rocio</i> of Lisbon, and several persons were killed and wounded,
a Portuguese spectator did not seem in the least concerned
by the fact that men were being shot down, but much concerned
that it should be witnessed by foreigners. “A nice
thing for foreigners to see,” was all he said. Outwardly he
pays too much deference to the foreigner, and one cannot help
suspecting that all the time he is aware of his own greater
delicacy and of the poor foreigner’s ill manners. Being self-conscious
and susceptible and, moreover, himself intimately
persuaded that Portugal is a backward country unworthy of
Paris or London’s civilisation, he does not conceive that the
foreigner may be making comparisons favourable to the
country he is visiting, but easily imagines that he is slighting
or smiling at him and his customs. His own love of satire
and ridicule which is apt to paralyse his private initiative and
political action, makes him prone to suspect ridicule in others.
He will then brood silently over his offended feelings, and
nurse his susceptibilities till they have vent in one of those
sudden outbreaks not unknown to quiet natures. But the
Portuguese, despite his exaggerated politeness towards the
stranger in his land, and a very real and hospitable wish to be
of help to him, does not love foreigners. A Spanish writer
in the seventeenth century, Vicente Espinel, described the
Portuguese as “<i>gente idólatra de si propria, que no estima en
nada el resto del mundo</i>.” If he despised foreigners then, it is
scarcely to be wondered at if he should dislike or distrust them
now. Vast colonies and the lordship of the sea, which were
once Portugal’s, are now in the hands of other nations, and
she never forgets this. She considers herself to be, like the
fallen Napoleon, at once “conqueror and captive of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
earth.” Were Germany mistress of the seas, and London
fallen from its high estate to a provincial destiny, the English
would probably feel some bitterness towards not only their
German conquerors but all foreigners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dream of Vanished Splendour.</div>

<p>And if the Portuguese does not easily forget that Portugal
was once the greatest empire in Europe, he considers that
other nations forget it too often. It may
be that other nations sometimes do not allow
sufficiently for the fact that without pioneer
Portugal their own empires had been less
easy of acquisition, but it would certainly be to Portugal’s
advantage were she herself to forget it occasionally. Under
modern conditions it is of little use for a penniless person to
dwell on the fact that his ancestors possessed vast estates:
he must make the best of his present poverty, and, if he has
some estates left which cost him more than they bring in, he
will think no shame to sell part in order to be able to administer
the rest—always provided he can find a purchaser. But the
majority of Portuguese reject indignantly the idea of parting
with an inch of their Indian or African possessions. Rather
their thoughts run to extending their territory, to the construction
of a fleet, or the conquest of Spain. Even the idea
of a general subscription among the whole population is not
unknown, with a view to securing one or more of these objects.
Dr. Affonso Costa knew his countrymen well when he promised
them a large surplus, to be employed in building a fleet. Such
is the great but misguided patriotism of the Portuguese
people, while the interests and well-being of Portugal itself,
which only needs proper development to become a flourishing
country, are overlooked. They dream of high-flown projects
and the work immediately to hand is—postponed. The
Portuguese people is not really indifferent, or at least its indifference
is confined to the play of party politics in Lisbon.
In the fall and rise of a ministry, in the debates of Parliament
or in the elections, the interest of the country at large is of
the slightest. The expectations of the people have been too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
frequently disappointed for it to set great store now by
political promises, but the Portuguese have a real love of their
country for which they are willing to sacrifice much—everything,
it sometimes seems, except personal vanity and party
intrigues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forms of Address.</div>

<p>Another apparent inconsistency is the democratic feeling
which, in private life, prevails in Portugal to a greater degree
than perhaps in any other country, social
distinctions being often ignored there, not
only by those who are not distinguished but
by those who are, to an extent that would be utterly impossible
in England. For this democratic usage has to be reconciled
with the widespread vanity of the Portuguese. In place of
the plain “you” employed in England in addressing king
or cobbler, there are in Portugal all kinds of gradations, from
<i>Vossa Excellencia</i> to <i>O senhor</i> (in the third person), <i>Vossemecé</i>,
or the more familiar <i>Vossé</i>, which even so is a contraction of
“Your Worship.” Ladies are always addressed as <i>Vossa
Excellencia</i>, and are given the title of <i>Dona</i> (= the Spanish
<i>Doña</i>). The title <i>Dom</i> is only given to men belonging to old
aristocratic families, whereas in Spain the use of <i>Don</i> is, of
course, far more general, and in South America it descends
still further, corresponding there, indeed, to the English use
of “Mr.” instead of “Esq.” Letters are often addressed to
the Most Illustrious, Most Excellent, <i>Senhor</i>, and, generally,
the Portuguese are more ceremonious even than the Spanish.
The humanist, Luis Vives, in the sixteenth century, complained
of the pomposity of address then beginning in Spain
(<i>i.e.</i>, Spain and Portugal) and Italy: and soon, he said, we
shall be saying “Your Deity”—<i>mox, ut opinor, Deitas</i>.
But the fiery Spanish dignity is absent, although the Portuguese
have a quiet resolution and dignity of their own, and
their gentle sadness rarely sinks to a spiritless despondency,
and still more rarely to the grovelling abjection—lowest of the
low—described by Byron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peasants.</div>

<p>The Portuguese peasantry, especially, is gifted with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
delicacy and intelligence which make life pleasant and poverty
no hardship in that climate. The illiterate are often the
flower and cream of the nation. They are
able to express themselves with fluency and
correctness, in fact you will often find a peasant’s
speech purer and more refined in accent than that of an
educated Portuguese, and will be amazed at the clearness and
delicacy of tone and expression coming from a person barefoot
and in tatters. Thrice fortunate they who can associate and
converse with the peasants during the summer <i>romaria</i> or village
<i>festa</i>, or as they sit round the winter fire (<i>a lareira</i>), or
gather for some great common task, a shearing (<i>tosquia</i>) or
<i>esfolhada</i> (separating the maize cob from its sheath), for they
are certain to glean a rich store of proverbs, folk-lore, and
philology, and will learn much about spirits and witches.
These peasants have poetical imagination, witty speech, no
dearth of ideas, a ready sympathy, and, moreover, a sobriety,
patience and self-control which are the more remarkable in
that by nature, although not quick, they are impulsive and
extraordinarily sensitive. It may be said without exaggeration
that the Portuguese people, for all its colossal ignorance
and lack of letters, is one of the most civilised and intelligent
in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Folk-Lore.</div>

<p>It is full of superstitions, and in few countries—Ireland again
naturally occurs to the mind—can there be more legends and
charms and incantations, ignorance thus
fostering an immense popular literature in
prose and verse. The varieties of sorcerers
and diviners are many: there are <i>benzedores</i> and <i>imaginarios</i>,
<i>magicos</i> and <i>agoureiros</i>, <i>bruxas</i> and <i>feiticeiras</i>, etc., etc.
Only during the last thirty years has this begun to be a written
literature, thanks to the brilliant initiative and untiring
researches of Z. Consiglieri Pedroso, A. T. Pires, Snr. F.
Adolpho Coelho, Snr. Leite de Vasconcellos, Snr. Theophilo
Braga and others. Round every hill and stream of the country
has the people woven some quaint fancy or preserved some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
ancient myth or fact. To take a solitary instance: the
great rock (<i>Pedra Amarella</i>), above the convent of Pena
Longa, at the foot of the Serra de Cintra, is covered with yellow
moss. What is the explanation of this? That the moss grew
there, you say. But the Portuguese people is not likely to
dismiss anything in heaven or earth with four words. The
fact is that an old woman, believing this rock to contain a
hidden treasure, was anxious to break it open and to that
purpose kept throwing eggs at it. She did not succeed in
her object, but the rock remains covered with the yolks of the
eggs. The Portuguese people is especially devoted to music,
flowers, dance and song. The humblest, most ramshackle
cottage will have an old tin of carnations on its window ledge
or hanging anyhow from the wall. Many of the flowers have
popular names of no little charm. <i>Goivo</i>, the old Portuguese
word for joy, is given both to the stock and the wallflower,
the fuchsia is <i>lagrimas</i> (tears), anemones <i>beijinhos</i> (little
kisses), the roadside iris is <i>lirio</i> (lily), any downhanging
creeper is <i>chorão</i> (weeper). A common creeper of that name
grows extraordinarily fast, and once boasted that it would scale
heaven, whereupon it was sentenced to advance always in a
downward direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popular “Cantigas.”</div>

<p>Of the fascinating popular quatrains (<i>quadras</i>) an immense
collection might be formed, indeed some of those already in
existence are not trifling, as, for instance, the
<i>10,000 Cantos populares portuguezes</i>, collected
in four volumes by A. Thomaz Pires (Elvas,
1902-10). Those who are alarmed by so great a number
may read the <i>Cancioneiro popular</i> (Porto, 1914), selected by
Snr. Jaime Cortesão, which contains 563. Or, still better,
make a selection of their own, writing them down at the dictation
of many a peasant who can himself neither write nor read.
These <i>cantigas</i> or <i>quadras</i> spring up continually like mushrooms,
and perish unrecorded, or go from mouth to mouth
of the illiterate in endless variation. They are delightful
examples of unpremeditated art, many of them showing real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
delicacy and poetical imagination, more so than the melancholy
<i>fado</i> or ballad of fate of the professional <i>fadistas</i>. A vague
melancholy underlies most of these <i>cantigas</i>. Sadly in the
soft summer evenings many a <i>canção perdida</i> is sung to the
slow and plaintive accompaniment of the guitar—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illiterate Poets.</div>

<p>Anyone with a spirit of enterprise and a thorough knowledge
of Portuguese might collect a goodly crop of such <i>cantigas</i>,
together with thousands of delightful expressions
and sayings peculiar to each region
of Portugal. Minho especially, that charming
province of crystal streams and cool maize-fields, offers a
wide scope. But it is a narrowing opportunity, since education,
however slow its progress in Portugal, is gradually advancing.
Many of the <i>cantigas</i>, composed by illiterate persons, are not
intended to survive the occasion that gave them birth. Hence
their naturalness and charm. The lovely Greek epigrams show
a more conscious art. They are the perfect daffodils and
hyacinths, whereas the Portuguese <i>cantigas</i> are the forgotten
celandines and primroses of the lanes and woods. In 1911
died an old workman of Setubal, Antonio Maria Euzebio
(born in 1820), who could neither read nor write, but had
composed verses with great ease from an early age. A volume
of his verses was published in 1901, with introduction by
Snr. Theophilo Braga and Snr. Guerra Junqueiro. Of a
poetic art as such he had no glimmering, but, in Portugal at
least, such ignorance would help rather than injure him as
a poet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature and Art.</div>

<p>The Portuguese are richly gifted by nature, but, in matters
of art or in artificial surroundings, their natural taste sometimes
seems to desert them. <i>Corruptio optimi</i>.
Under circumstances which do not allow
them to be themselves some of the aspersions
of an eighteenth century writer may be true of them: “Ils
sont jaloux au suprême degré,” wrote the author of the
<i>Description de la ville de Lisbonne</i> (Amsterdam, 1738), “dissimulés,
vindicatifs, railleurs, vains et présomptueux sans
sujet.” (The same writer admits that they have great virtues:
“Ils ont avec beaucoup de vivacité et de pénétration un
attachement extraordinaire pour leur Prince; ils sont fort
secrets, fidèles amis, généreux, charitables envers leurs
parens, sobres dans leur manger, ne mangeant presque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
que du poisson, ris, vermicelli, légumes, confitures, et ne buvant
pour l’ordinaire que de l’eau.”) The family life of a Portuguese,
especially in some country <i>quinta</i>, is extremely attractive,
and he only becomes uninteresting when he follows the
customs of foreign nations. So long as he is natural, few
nations excel him; when he ceases to be natural he lags
woefully behind in the ruts of foreign imitation. There was
a grain of truth in the remark of a critic that Camões, with
a great lyrical gift, was unsuccessful in the sonnet owing to his
attempt to introduce naturalness into an essentially artificial
form. The Portuguese, where their love of nature does not
help them, are left at the mercy of extravagance and
tawdriness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artistic Sense.</div>

<p>Not that the ordinary artisan does not turn out much good
honest work. Indeed, while the Spanish make things for
show rather than for use, and the French for
a little of both, the Portuguese agrees with
the English in making them with a regard for
comfort and a sublime unconcern for the look of them. And
in this no doubt they show their good sense. But they are
not artistic. This is shown in a thousand ways, in the curve
of a chair, the finish of a book-case, in their buildings, in the
colour of their dress and of the wash for their houses, in which
squashed hues, and especially pink, predominate; in the
shape of the water-jars, in which the soul of a Latin people
is often expressed. (The Portuguese jars are often rather
useful than ornamental, squat in shape, fashioned to contain
the greatest possible quantity of water, and with but one
handle, for use, instead of two, for art’s sake.) In the construction
of modern houses, as in many matters of daily life,
the Portuguese makes comfort or a saving of trouble the
principal consideration. Their ancient buildings in which,
indeed, foreign architects had no little part—Batalha, for
instance, or Alcobaça—can vie in beauty with those of any
country. But, although Manoeline architecture in some cases
may have justified its existence, in principle it was an outrage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
against pure Gothic, and a similar tastelessness may be noted
in daily life at the present time. The undertakers add a
horror to death in other cities besides Lisbon, but in no other
can the grandest funerals be marked by a more grotesque and
fantastic ugliness. Nor is it easy to forget a coffin at a funeral
in the provinces—not that of a child. It was bright pink with
silver scales. It is most curious, this tendency to tinsel on the
part of a people which appears to have natural good taste.
Perhaps it is an importation from the East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soft Wax.</div>

<p>Certainly foreign influences and a half-education are
extremely dangerous in Portugal. In many parts of the
country the people is still unspoilt, and the
demagogue and politician appear like a bull
in a china shop, with vast possibilities of
damage and destruction. Portugal is but a little wax, wrote
the novelist Eça de Queiroz (1843-1900). The Portuguese
people is “soft wax” repeated Snr. Guerra Junqueiro in 1896:
“What we need is a great sculptor.” The history of Portugal
has been the history of a few great men who have passed on the
torch of her glories from century to century, a Nun’ Alvares,
the soldier-saint, or the splendid Affonso d’Albuquerque,
who often found it as difficult to cope with his own followers as
with the enemy in the East. But for all that Portugal is a land
of strongly-rooted and noble traditions, and these the required
sculptor must take into account if he is to be successful in his
task. It would be wrong to infer that the anonymous mass
that forms the background to those great figures of the past
is characterless. For, beneath the apathy, the docility, the
contradictions of the Portuguese people remains something
perhaps not very easy to define, but which has an intimate
peculiar flavour, something pliant, adaptable, insinuating but
with a real will and persistency of its own. Potential, it may
be, rather than actual, but certainly a sound and promising
basis for growth and development, if properly directed.</p>

<p>“What is urgent,” to quote again Snr. Guerra Junqueiro,
“is not a social or a political but a moral revolution.” “Quant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
à la moralité,” wrote M. Léon Poinsard later, in 1910, “elle
semble plutôt en voie de diminuer” (<i>Le Portugal Inconnu</i>).
A few years earlier a Lisbon newspaper, <i>O Diario de Noticias</i>,
in a leading article (16th September, 1902) deplored the
<i>podridão moral</i> of Portuguese society, the “<i>perversão de caracteres
e desbragamento dos costumes politicos</i>.” Such remarks apply
usually to Lisbon rather than to Portugal as a whole. In
village life, considering the circumstances, the absolute lack
of direction, the landed gentry absentee, the authority of the
priest undermined, morality may be said to stand remarkably
high. And the great mass of the Portuguese people is,
emphatically, <i>désorienté</i> rather than degenerate. They would
answer readily—yes, even Beckford’s Lisbon <i>canaille</i>—to a
leader capable of leading something more than a pack of
yelping political parasites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portuguese at Home.</div>

<p>It must always be remembered that the foreigner often views
the Portuguese at his worst, in an artificial atmosphere,
rarely in his natural life and surroundings.
He seldom has occasion to see him in his
home life, in which the real affectionateness
of his nature is evident, nor to realise the
nobility and delicacy of his dreams and ideals which are so
often shattered by harsh reality, and the genuine kindliness
which proves that his politeness and courtesy are not merely
superficial. If they have not the immediate attraction of
some other nations, they prove, on longer acquaintance, to
be a people not only pleasant but of a real good-nature, of a
child-like simplicity beneath their vanity, and with a certain
strength and determination for all their apparent pliancy.
Intensely susceptible and easily driven by rudeness and violence
into furtive, hypocritical and vindictive tactics, they
answer with extreme goodwill to any show of friendliness and
respect. If they are capable rather of occasional heroic
actions than of securing a gradual prosperity, they are nevertheless
a people peculiarly gifted, under proper guidance, to
achieve what, presumably, is the end to which modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
civilisation aspires—a state of peace and culture with ever-widening
and deepening international relations. Only, of
course, such relations can never be set on a satisfactory basis
by sacrificing anything that is genuinely Portuguese. For a
nation can hardly look for respect which has nothing of its
own to offer, and prides itself exclusively on its foreign
imitations. And the Portuguese of all peoples will find their
best models in their own past history and literature. Voltaire,
not a bad judge in the matter of wit, called the Portuguese
“<i>une nation spirituelle</i>,” and, in spite of all their national
misfortunes, a witty nation they remain. It will be well if
their wit be directed not to pull down national customs and
institutions, but—as by many writers of the sixteenth century—against
those who ape foreign manners.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Census of 1911.</div>

<p>The latest census of the population, that is, the returns at the
end of the year 1911,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> presents some interesting figures. This
is the fifth census taken in Portugal. The
first, in 1864, gave the population as 4,118,410,
in the census of 1878 it was 4,698,984, of 1890
5,049,729, and of 1900 5,423,132. That of 1911 gives a
population of 5,960,056. Thus, in fifty years the population
of Portugal has increased by nearly a third, and, although
something must be allowed for the more accurate returns in
recent years, is evidently in no danger of diminishing, in spite
of increasing emigration. Moreover, there are no less than
211,813 families (over a seventh of the whole number,
1,411,327) of seven or more persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing Population.</div>

<p>The density is 65 persons to the square <i>kilomètre</i>, as compared
with 44 for the average of all Europe, Portugal coming
eleventh on the list of European countries,
Spain nineteenth (39 persons to the square
<i>kilomètre</i>). The district which shows the
largest increase is that of Minho (including the country between
the rivers Douro and Minho), which was already overcrowded
in 1900 with 162 inhabitants to the square <i>kilomètre</i>.
It now has 178. Estremadura (which includes Lisbon) has also
risen considerably—from 68 to 80. The other provinces show
a much slighter increase (Beira Alta from 88 to 95, Algarve
from 50 to 54, Beira Baixa from 39 to 42, Traz os Montes from
39 to 40, Alemtejo from 17 to 20).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreigners.</div>

<p>Other points of interest are the increase of the city population<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
at the rate of 15 per cent., one-third more, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
than the rate of increase for the country population, and
the decrease in the number of foreigners by some 500 since
the beginning of the century (41,197 in 1911, 41,728 in 1900,
41,339 in 1890). The number of Spaniards
has fallen from 27,029 in 1900 to 20,517 in
1911, the French from 1,841 to 1,832, Italians
from 561 to 547, Belgians from 188 to 170. On the other
hand, the number of Brazilians has increased from 7,594
to 12,143, of English from 2,292 to 2,516, Germans from
929 to 969.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Details of Population.</div>

<p>In the census of 1900 there were 108·8 women to 100 men
in the population of Portugal. During the next ten years
the percentage slightly increased, so that
there are now 110 women to 100 men, that is,
4 per cent. more than in any other country
of Europe. The census of 1911 gives the number of persons
over eighty years of age in Portugal as nearly one per cent.
of the entire population: 52,783. Of these 31,891 were
women, and 20,892 men. These figures are subdivided as
follows: Women, between 80 and 84 years, 21,154; from
85 to 89 years, 6,489; from 90 to 94 years, 2,900; from 95 to
99 years, 992; over 100 years, 265. The corresponding
numbers of men are 14,256, 4,452, 1,554, 500, 130.
This says much for the excellence of the climate and
the hardiness of the race. On the other hand, the
mortality among the children of the poor is enormous:
it is quite common for two to grow up out of a family of
seven or nine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emigration.</div>

<p>Emigration from Portugal has increased on a vast scale in
recent years. The official statistics for 1909 (published in
1912) gave the number of emigrants as 30,288.
Other statistics for the same year gave 38,213,
of whom 30,580 were bound for Brazil. Both
figures are well below the truth if the clandestine emigration
is taken into account. It is impossible to keep count of those
who cross the frontier into Spain, and many even of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
emigrate by sea succeed in escaping registration. In 1908
the number of registered emigrants was 35,731, in 1907 31,312,
in 1906 27,332, in 1905 25,594. Of the 30,288 emigrants of
1909 25,039 were male (of whom 12,822 could read) and
5,249 women (of whom only 804 could read). Since 1909
the emigration has doubled and trebled. A Republican newspaper,
<i>O Seculo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> printed some figures in 1913. The writer
pointed out that there were whole regions in Portugal without
labourers for the fields, and that whole families were now
emigrating as never before. Emigration agencies <i>pululam
por todo o Norte</i>, fourteen agencies being established in Oporto
alone. The <i>Diario de Noticias</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> declared that there were tens
of leagues of uncultivated land in Portugal, while over two
millions sterling of cereals were imported annually. In 1912
the number of emigrants had more than trebled since 1902 in
the districts of Oporto, Coimbra, Guarda, Vianna, Vizeu, Villa
Real, Bragança, Leiria and Santarem. In the last five
districts it had more than doubled since 1910. The figures
given for the district of Bragança were 10,504 in 1912, 6,331
in 1907, and 550 in 1902! (the other chief increase being at
Villa Real, respectively 7,732, 3,140, and 1,356). These are the
two principal towns of Traz os Montes. The total number of
emigrants in 1912 bordered on 100,000; but in 1914 there was
a notable decrease. A large number of the emigrants go to
Brazil (and indeed they are totally unfitted to go to any country
of which they do not know the language), and maintain relations
with the mother country, sending money home and
sometimes returning as enriched <i>Brazileiros</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salaries.</div>

<p>In Portugal the salaries are low and give no great incentive
to labour, especially as they have remained almost stationary,
while the price of food and rent has risen.
Even during the long harvest days the women
receive only a shilling a day or even less for
working perhaps sixteen hours in the fields, the men two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
shillings or less. Some instances of wages are given in M.
Poinsard’s <i>Le Portugal Inconnu</i>. A day labourer of the
Douro district receives 200 <i>réis</i> (= tenpence), an agricultural
labourer in Alemtejo 250 (500 in time of harvest), a carpenter
of the Serra da Estrella 320 <i>réis</i>, a miner in a lead-mine near
Aveiro 350, a mason of Minho 400, a carpenter of Braga 400,
a weaver of Guimarães 500, a mason of Lisbon 700, a weaver
of Lisbon 700, a shoemaker’s assistant at Coimbra from
220 to 440, a carpenter in Alemtejo 400, a dressmaker’s
assistant in Lisbon 240.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poverty and Ignorance.</div>

<p>Many families live from day to day and from hand to mouth
by odd jobs, and the tendency to live thus precariously has
been increased by the recent unrest. They
live on little or nothing, and devote all their
energy and wits to pay arrears of rent sufficient
to prevent them from being turned out of their houses, which
often consist of but one or two rooms. In one instance a
family of seven lives in a single room, the entire furniture
consisting of an old mattress in one corner. Needless to say,
the windows are kept closed at night and there is no fire-place,
a comparatively rare thing in the Portuguese climate.
(The cooking is done over three stones.) Far worse than
their poverty is their ignorance and carelessness of health and
hygiene. Not that these deficiencies are confined to the
peasants of Portugal, but they are most serious in a hot
climate. Little attention is given to the advantages of air
and water, and what wonder when even educated persons pay
little heed to them. During some days of exceptional heat,
in the summer of 1913, the correspondent of a Lisbon newspaper
at Oporto wrote that the heat there had been so terrible
that windows had to be kept open at night. And this in a
climate which rarely gives excuse for closed windows. There
is no direction from above; many villages have not a single
educated inhabitant, and but few inhabitants who can write or
read, and have not even a church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanitation.</div>

<p>The mayors of many a town and village are too much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
occupied with high politics to think of such sublunary matters
as the cleanliness of the streets. Rubbish is left in the burning
sun for children to play in, street, river, and
cliff being polluted with it, and many small
towns are in a truly miserable state. The
mayor of one of them was asked why a cart was not sent to
collect the rubbish, and his answer was typical. Although it
was well known that no such cart was in existence, he did
not say that a cart would be sent or that he would see what
could be done or any other such polite evasion. He merely
said that a cart is sent every day, and there was an end of the
matter. With such simplicity are these questions solved.
It is worth while to dwell on such matters since they are of
more importance than fine-sounding party programmes. The
local authorities, appointed for party reasons, would no
doubt scout the idea that anti-clericalism may be of less value
than the destruction of flies. They drive out the “ominous
<i>soutane</i>,” and the land, as Egypt of old, is “corrupted by
reason of the swarm of flies.” “The unhealthiness of a great
part of the country, the crowded and sometimes wretched
houses, the complete absence of any hygienic discipline among
the rural population, are other probable causes of the lack of
energy of the agricultural labourer, who for the rest is constitutionally
capable of great endurance.... With notable
power of endurance, a climate which permits an almost
uninterrupted activity, both for labourers and vegetation,
the agricultural population of Portugal will have a wide
future before it when food, houses, and hygiene are improved,
and many regions rendered more healthy, when irrigation
and technical instruction are extended, crops better adapted
to the soil, machinery more generally employed and agrarian
societies organised.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Overcrowding and Starvation.</div>

<p>In many houses such a thing as a bed is unknown, but in
houses that can afford it the articles are far more numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
(and ugly) than, for instance, in Spain, and in the kitchen an
infinite variety of pots and pans fills up the room to the
exclusion of cleanliness. Many families subsist
on bread, potatoes, mussels, sardines, with
occasional rice and <i>bacalhau</i>, meat being
unknown. Their state has not changed much
since the sixteenth century, when many of the Portuguese
are represented as “ne vivant quasi d’autre chose que de
caracolles, de moulles et petits poissons”—a people “non
adonné aux superfluités.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> With overcrowding in unhealthy
quarters in the towns and gnawing poverty in the country
it is not surprising that the mortality is high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absentee Landlords.</div>

<p>The evils are increased by the total lack of direction.
Sometimes at the very gates of a large and flourishing property
one comes across a village of tumble-down
hovels like so many walls of loose stones
built irregularly and picturesquely along a
“street” of stone and rock which becomes a torrent in winter;
and one is inclined to compare them with the neat, comfortable
cottages in villages under the supervision of those “harassing”
English squires. Yet in each case it needs only the interest
and goodwill of one person to alter the state of the whole
village and give an impetus to cleanliness and comfort and
education, but that person will certainly not be the agent of
an absentee landlord.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A FARMHOUSE, MINHO</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Small Holdings of Minho.</div>

<p>In the size of holdings there is the same difference between
the north and south of Portugal as between Galicia and
Andalucía in Spain. In Minho the land is all
dividing walls and hedges round diminutive
fields, the average size of holdings being under
an acre, and many of them mere patches the
size of a pocket handkerchief. In 1908 for 5,423,132 inhabitants
the number of holdings was given as 11,430,740! “And
if it is considered that this division is increased in, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
confined to part of the centre and to the north, the extent
of the evil will be clear. I know of many proprietors
who, to obtain a total rent of fifteen or twenty <i>escudos</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
have over a hundred properties scattered over the parish,
the rent of some of them representing fractions of a halfpenny....
In many parishes of the north there are olives, chestnut-trees
and oaks in the property of one person but belonging
to someone else, and sometimes these trees are divided between
more than one owner.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Large Estates.</div>

<p>In Alemtejo the average size of a property is forty or fifty
times greater than in the north, properties of 20,000 acres
being not unknown. Alemtejo, under the
Romans flourishing with corn, has large
tracts of waste land, and when the land is
cultivated modern machinery is rarely in use. When introduced
by the owner of the land it is allowed to fall out of use,
if possible, by the workmen, and at harvest time one has the
picturesque sight of an interminable row of labourers at work
without any of the noise and bustle of machinery. It has
been suggested that some of the emigrants from the north
of the country should be encouraged to go to Alemtejo instead
of Brazil, and that the cultivation of seven or eight hundred
more acres of Alemtejo as corn-land would put an end to the
importation of corn which now drains the country of hundreds
of thousands of pounds yearly, and seems to belie the undoubted
fact that Portugal is above all an agricultural country.
There are difficulties in the way of the scheme, since Alemtejo
is a little too near home to form the Eldorado of the peasant
of Minho and Traz os Montes. Moreover, if a part of Alemtejo
were subdivided into small holdings for peasant colonists,
whatever advantages were given to them the probability is
that the holdings would gradually accumulate in the hands
of one or two persons and form a few more Alemtejan <i>montes</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and <i>herdades</i>. At least this was the result of a similar
experiment in Andalucía.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irrigation.</div>

<p>There is also the difficulty of water, Alemtejo more than
the rest of Portugal standing in need of irrigation (artesian
wells), although irrigation is welcome to
agriculture throughout the country in view
of the long summer droughts. Given water,
vegetation of all kinds grows and prospers with marvellous
rapidity in this land of hot sun and warm air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afforestation.</div>

<p>A requirement that goes hand in hand with irrigation is
that of afforestation. It is true that woods cover above
22 per cent. of the total area of Portugal,
which is double the average in Spain and
two-thirds of the average in Europe. The
cultivated area was given as 5,068,454 <i>hectares</i> in 1906, the
uncultivated as 3,842,186. Trees were calculated to occupy
some 1,700,000 <i>hectares</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and most of these trees are of a
valuable kind. Those of widest extension are pines (about
430,000 <i>hectares</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>), evergreen oaks (<i>azinheiras</i>: 416,000
<i>hectares</i>), cork-trees (366,000<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>), and olives (329,000). Chestnuts
cover some 84,000 <i>hectares</i>, and oaks 47,000.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But,
especially in Traz os Montes, Alemtejo, and the Serra da
Estrella, there is plenty of scope for afforestation. In the
latter, which compares so unfavourably with the well-wooded
Serra do Gerez, something has been done. Near Manteigas
about 2,000 acres have been afforested (chiefly with pine and
oak). In 1913 alone some four hundred bushels of acorns
were sown. Altogether since the law of 1901, which placed
the woods under the Department of Public Works, some
12,000 acres have been afforested<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> by the State, and private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
individuals are said to afforest almost as many acres annually,
the State selling 30,000 kilos (at threepence the kilo)<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of pine
seed yearly. The State itself possesses comparatively little
land, and the town councils have shown no inclination to
be dispossessed of their commons. The more enlightened
Portuguese from King Diniz onwards have always been
keenly alive to the advantages of afforestation, but the more
remote town councils have done nothing to counteract the
destruction of trees at the hands of the peasants.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> At the
new annual “Festival of the Tree” trees are planted throughout
the country by the school-children. The yield of a <i>hectare</i>
of the famous Leiria pine woods is estimated at four <i>milreis</i>,
and the expense at one <i>milreis</i>, giving a net profit of about
twelve shillings. This would be increased by easier and
cheaper means of transport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roads.</div>

<p>The state of the Portuguese roads has recently been attracting
much attention, and during the last sixty years has been
the constant care of Ministers of Public
Works. (This department was created in
1852.) About 13,000 miles of roads have
been projected by the State, only about a half of which
have been constructed<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—almost all in the second half
of last century. The worst is, however, not that roads
are not made, but that there is apparently no money to keep
them in repair. Yet an average of over a thousand contos
has been spent on roads annually during the last sixty years.
A writer recently in <i>O Seculo</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> remarks that Portugal “is
imperfectly equipped with roads and, moreover, those which
exist are in such a state, in most districts, that they can scarcely
be used. We know various places which are so to say isolated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
from neighbouring towns, and can only be approached easily
by railway. The state of the roads with ruts and holes in
which carts sink has in certain parts given rise to a curious
industry, that of rescuing vehicles which have stuck fast.
It is exercised by peasants possessing yokes of oxen, who at
sunrise, armed with hooks and ropes, lead them to the worst
places, and there wait patiently for a motor-car or other
vehicle to sink in, and then immediately offer their assistance,
in return for a few shillings or pence, according to the quality
of the vehicle and its occupants.” Motor-cars, which are
surprisingly numerous in Portugal, and are all imported from
abroad, deserve a better fate than this, considering that they
pay a tax of £24 at the Customs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Propaganda de Portugal.</div>

<p>But, on the whole, the roads of Portugal compare favourably
with those of Spain, and any improvement to encourage
tourists must be carried out in connection
with Spain, that is, with the roads between the
Portuguese frontier and Irun. Now, both
in Portugal and Spain, societies are established to watch
over the interests of tourists. The Sociedade de Propaganda
de Portugal, which is doing good work, has its headquarters
at the <i>Largo das duas Igrejas</i>, Lisbon, and is most prompt
and willing in answering any inquiries. It may be hoped
that improvement will be rapid, and of course it is equally
important for agriculture, which especially requires the
construction of a large number of small by-roads. The
construction of roads in both countries has been too often
intimately connected with politics, and their repair, when
entrusted to the local authorities, has been a disastrous failure.
Were a first-rate road to prolong to the Portuguese frontier
the road of five hundred miles from Paris to the Bidasoa,
and could the roads in Portugal be compared with those of
the Basque provinces (both in France and in Spain), a country
so beautiful and with so many famous buildings would be
overrun with motor-cars (so that quiet people would flee to
the mountains).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Railways.</div>

<p>The railways are even more deficient. When those in
construction have been completed the total will amount to a
little over two thousand miles. The whole
of the south of Portugal is served by but one
line, which goes from Lisbon (<i>i.e.</i>, from
Barreiro across the Tagus) to Faro, branching off midway to
Evora and Villa Viçosa and again to Moura. The journey to
Faro requires over twelve hours, with the result that Algarve
is practically cut off from the capital. The desert of Sahara
is scarcely more remote. A briefer route and a bridge over
the Tagus at Lisbon are in contemplation. Hitherto facilities
given to travel have chiefly taken into consideration persons
leaving Portugal or coming so far as Lisbon and Oporto only,
and many of the most delightful and characteristic parts of
the country are left unvisited.</p>

<p>The postal service between Lisbon and foreign countries
is good, but in the provinces it differs little from the service
in Spain, where the receipt of a letter is as hazardous as the
winning of a prize in the lottery.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mines.</div>

<p>Besides tourists and agriculture, improvement in the
communications would encourage the development of the
mining industry. At present the number of
miners in Portugal is small, although the
subsoil is known to be rich in minerals.
Many of the mines that are worked are in the hands of foreigners,
and the minerals are often exported in the condition in
which they leave the mine. The statistics for 1912 show an
increase in the production of coal (70 <i>contos</i>), iron (21), copper
(254), and tin (33). The mineral obtained in largest quantities
is wolfram; gold, antimony, uranium, zinc, and other
minerals are produced on a very small scale. The total
yearly output of the mines in Portugal is estimated at under
£400,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fishing Industries.</div>

<p>About 60,000 persons, or one per cent. of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
population, are engaged in fishing or in selling or
preparing fish. Sardines are very plentiful, and donkeys
laden with them are driven far inland. The
number of Portuguese who go to the north
seas to fish for <i>bacalhau</i> has greatly increased
in recent years, and in 1911 amounted to 1,400, in forty-five
boats of an average size of 280 tons, whereas in 1902
there were but fifteen boats with an average size of 180 tons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese Manufactures.</div>

<p>The number of workmen employed in the cutting and
preparation of cork may be 5,000, but, even if these be included,
the total industrial population of Portugal
will scarcely exceed three per cent. of the
whole population. The largest number are
employed in cotton and woollen factories of the north (Covilhã
Guimarães, Portalegre, etc.), the former with some 30,000,
the latter with some 10,000 workmen. A far smaller number
are engaged in factories of paper, glass, glazed tiles (<i>azulejos</i>),
silk, etc.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Portuguese industries, although they are bolstered
up by an excessive protection, are not congenial to the climate
or the character of the people, and but for protection many
of them could not exist for a month, while under protection
they tend to vegetate and to raise the prices rather than the
quality of their products. It is sometimes complained that
the Methuen treaty killed Portuguese cottons and woollens,
but as a matter of fact an even more exaggerated protection
could not enable them to compete with foreign goods. They
are exported chiefly to the Portuguese colonies; the woollen
goods supplied in Portugal are mostly of a very rough sort,
such as peasants’ caps and cloaks, excellent of their kind.
The Portuguese have always shown a preference for English
stuffs.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the same way the paper produced is of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
commonest; perhaps the only manufacture in which they
excel is that of the glazed tiles, with which so many houses
are lined within and without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agriculture.</div>

<p>The main business of the Portuguese is not industry, not
even politics, but agriculture,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the number of persons engaged
in agriculture being calculated at about three-fifths
of the whole population. Agriculture
often, too often, means vineyards. The soil
and sun of Portugal combine to make it a land of the grape;
and along the sea vines can grow where other crops cannot,
dying down to escape the winter storms, then receiving the
spring rains till the grapes begin to swell and sweeten in the
summer months of drought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wines.</div>

<p>Nearly every other village seems to be celebrated for its
wines—common wines prepared without care, and selling for
twopence or threepence the <i>litre</i> bottle. The
yearly average of production is about a hundred
<i>litres</i> to every inhabitant in Portugal.
The wines chiefly exported are of course port wine and
Madeira.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The wines of Collares, Bucellas, and Carcavellos
have a great reputation in Portugal, as also those of Ribatejo,
the <i>Moscatel</i> of Setubal, and the light <i>vinhos verdes</i> of Minho
(Amarante, Basto, Monsão). The famous treaty of Methuen
in 1703, which stipulated that Portuguese wines should be
exported to England at a reduced tariff (see pages 126 and 225)
has been blamed by some Portuguese for the fall of the price
of wines in Portugal. That is, they blame England because
the Portuguese after the treaty, in their eagerness to benefit
by it, devoted themselves to vine-growing to the exclusion of
other branches of agriculture. The Portuguese vine-growers
have had to contend against this over-production, against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the ravages of phylloxera, which a quarter of a century ago
destroyed nearly two hundred thousand acres (since for the
most part replanted), against foreign falsifications, against
the competition of France, Italy, and Spain.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Recently the
export of common red wines of Portugal to Brazil has greatly
increased, Brazil being now the country to which, after England,
Portugal exports most wine—as also the export of generous
wines to Germany since the German-Portuguese commercial
treaty of 1908. Against these advantages must be set
the closure of French markets and the decreasing popularity
of port wine in England. The districts of Portugal which
produce most wine are those of Lisbon (about 160,000 acres of
vineyards), Braga (about 75,000 acres), Vizeu (about 72,000
acres), Santarem (about 65,000), Oporto (about 62,000).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olive Oil.</div>

<p>The total cultivated area in Portugal exceeds twelve million
acres, and of this area olives occupy about a fifteenth, or
329,000 <i>hectares</i> (in 1906), vines 313,000 <i>hectares</i>,
and fruit trees (chiefly the fig, almond
and carob, which need little rain and flourish
in Algarve) about 630,000 acres. Olives are grown principally
in the districts of Santarem (75,000 <i>hectares</i>), Leiria (35,000),
Castello Branco (33,000), Beja, Bragança, and Coimbra (some
25,000 <i>hectares</i> each), and Faro (20,000). The annual export
of olive oil is considerable, but it cannot compare for excellence
with the oil of Italy: it is in fact from Italy that oil comes
for the tinning of fish in Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strange Imports.</div>

<p>But the most remarkable imports into Portugal are those
of wheat, maize and rice, in which, as in garden produce and
cattle, Portugal should be able to become
almost, if not quite, self-supporting. While
whole regions remain untilled and emigrants
are counted by the thousand monthly,
immense sums are spent every year in importing wheat and
maize: in 1913 the Treasury received about £600,000 merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
from the duty on these imports. Maize is grown chiefly in
the north, where in summer it gives a cool peaceful look to the
province of Minho, wheat in Alemtejo, and rye in Traz os
Montes. Official statistics for 1911 give the number of
<i>hectares</i> sown with corn as follows in the various districts:
Beja 117,324 (11·44 per cent. of the entire area of the district),
Castello Branco 68,299 (10·21 per cent.), Evora 65,290 (8·82),
Lisbon 54,810 (6·90), Portalegre 47,608 (7·64), Santarem
29,252 (4·41), Faro 19,648 (3·91), Bragança 18,563 (2·85),
Guarda 8,996 (1·64), Coimbra 5,754 (1·47), Vizeu 2,776 (·55),
Villa Real 2,691 (·60), Porto 2,064 (·89), Braga 1,492 (·55),
Aveiro 1,004 (·56), Vianna 996 (·44). Alemtejo, besides corn,
provides wide pasture lands, and live stock forms one of
Portugal’s principal exports (chiefly to England and Spain),
while, on the other hand, large quantities of meat are imported
from South America. Mules and pigs are most numerous in
the province of Alemtejo, horses and donkeys in Estremadura,
sheep and goats in Traz os Montes, and oxen in Minho.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exports and Imports.</div>

<p>Portugal’s chief exports, besides wine and cork, are cattle,
fish, fruits, minerals, wood, olive oil. There is no reason
why all of these, with the exception perhaps
of wine, should not show a gradual increase
as fresh markets are obtained, and better
methods (especially in the preparation of olive oil) and quicker
communications, which will enable Portuguese fruits and
flowers to be exported in ever-growing quantities.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The
principal imports, apart from machinery and articles of luxury,
are wheat, maize, sugar, cod, rice. A large number of Dutch
cheeses is imported every year, although the curious little
soft white cheeses, about the size of half a crown, are very
common in Portugal, and are a favourite food of the peasants.
Indolence, ignorance, mistaken finance and lack of capital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
have hitherto fettered agriculture in Portugal, neglect on the
part of the State and of private landowners going hand in
hand with illiteracy and distrust on the part of the peasants.
But it can hardly be doubted that Portuguese agriculture has
a prosperous future and that the miserable lot of the peasant
will be improved. Portugal should be able to become a land
of enlightened and cultured farmers, such as are sometimes
found in the north of Europe (for instance, in Denmark),
as it were a land of little Herculanos, combining farming with
scholarship.</p>

<span class="smaller">LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The “Chiado.”</div>

<p>For many, too many, Portuguese, Lisbon is Portugal. They
will put up with much misery in the provinces so long as
Lisbon has fine shops and streets and squares.
The ambition of the peasant is to see Lisbon,
and many prefer to live, however wretchedly,
as citizens of that great city than quietly at their ease in the
country. The rich inhabitants inhabit Paris, or else, as in
the days of Garrett, “spend their lives between the <i>Chiado</i> and
the <i>Rua do Oiro</i>,” although the motor-car now lures many
from the clubs of the <i>Rua Garrett</i> and the <i>cafés</i> of the Rocio at
least as far afield as Cintra or the Estoris. <i>Rua Garrett</i> is
now the official name (after the poet Almeida-Garrett, 1799-1854),
but it remains the <i>Chiado</i> in common speech. Its name
derived probably from the name, or rather from the nickname,
of another poet, Antonio Ribeiro, <i>o Chiado</i>. He was a popular
sixteenth-century Lisbon poet, and lived in a house just off
this street: it is thought that the frequent phrase “<i>Vámos ao
Chiado</i>” (“Let us go and see Chiado”) led to the name being
given to the street, hitherto called <i>Rua direita das Portas de
Santa Catharina</i>. The quaint lift which suspends people like
the mediaeval Virgil in a basket over the city, and, like some
of the other eight <i>ascensores</i>, gives a splendid view, still has
the words written up at its <i>Largo de São Julião</i> entrance:
“<span class="smcap">Ao Chiado</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Baixa.”</div>

<p>Lisbon, on its seven hills, has so few level spaces that people
naturally congregate, as water runs down from a mountain-side,
in the district between the Rocio and the
river, appropriately called the <i>Baixa</i>, the
Low Quarter, and meeting between acquaintances
is more frequent than in any other capital city. The
splendid <i>Avenida da Liberdade</i> has never become popular,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
and is apt to be deserted except on special occasions, a great
review or some Republican anniversary. It seems to be too
far from the centres of gossip: before you had walked from
the <i>Praça dos Restauradores</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the liberators of Portugal
from Spain in 1640) to the <i>Praça do Marquez de Pombal</i> and
back a ministry might have fallen. Best keep on the safe
side and miss nothing of the human comedy which in Lisbon
has centred in the <i>Rocio</i> throughout the centuries. Here
there is continual movement by day and night. Lisbon sits
up late and is an extremely late riser. Three o’clock on a
June morning sees the last revellers in the streets, and, later,
at an hour when other cities have put on their best clothes,
dust-bins still line the pavements, and the rag-pickers are at
their work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Singed Pigs.</div>

<p>Lisbon’s streets, spick and span, at least all those that the
passing tourist will see, give no idea of the accounts of all
writers a century ago, who in prose and verse
agreed about the dirt and nastiness of the
town. Indeed, so late as 1835 the suggestions
of a Portuguese writer for the improvement of the city give
some idea of its condition. It will be forbidden, said he,
to break in horses in the streets. It will be forbidden to kill
or singe pigs in the streets, or keep them alive in the streets,
or tied to the doors, “for all these things annoy the inhabitants.”
Dead animals were not to be left lying in the streets.
He noted, too, the number of stray dogs, the beggars at every
step, the filthiness of the outer staircases of the houses.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Some of the staircases had deep wells beneath them—there
was one at No. 17 rua da Prata, 19 <i>palmos</i> deep.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The great
houses had several, as also the convents; indeed, there is a
doleful history of how the Prioress fell into one of these on a
moonless night; however, she was fished out next morning,
and it was regarded as a miracle that her clothes were perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
dry, not even the <i>sabots</i> which she was wearing showing any
sign of water.</p>

</figure>

<div class="sidenote">The “Aguadeiros.”</div>

<p>But the wisest inhabitants of Lisbon sent and send their
servants and negro slaves to the public fountains or buy the
water brought thence by the <i>aguadeiros</i> who
may be seen barrel on shoulder in all the
narrow streets of the high-lying districts.
The water of many of these fountains is reputed to have
special virtues, as formerly the “fountain of the horses of
New Street,” taken before sunrise, miraculously healed diseases
of the eyes, and the same water “has the secret property of
speedily fattening the horses that drink of it, and it would
do the same to men if they went to drink of it at the fountain.”
Carrying heavy <i>bilhas</i> of water up Lisbon’s steep and narrow
streets is so arduous a business that the poorest inhabitants
prefer to pay a tiny sum to the <i>aguadeiro</i>, and in a country
where wine is often almost as common as water the qualities
of the various waters are discussed with perhaps greater
keenness than those of wines. In the sixteenth century the
number of water-sellers is given as twenty-six.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lisbon Streets and Houses.</div>

<p>Many houses, chiefly in the newer parts of the city, are
entirely covered outside with <i>azulejos</i>, mostly green or blue,
which give them a cool and cleanly appearance.
The rooms inside, too, often have a
pattern of <i>azulejos</i> several feet high round
the walls, and their use should be more
common in all hot countries. The low-lying part of Lisbon
between the <i>Rocio</i> (sometimes called Rolling Motion Square
or Turkey Square) and the <i>Terreiro do Paço</i> or <i>Praça do
Commercio</i> (Black Horse Square) was rebuilt in parallel
straight streets after the earthquake of 1755. These streets
seem narrow enough now, and the united breadth of them
would fit into the <i>Avenida da Liberdade</i>, but for the days of
the Marquez de Pombal their plan had a certain grandeur.
They still keep in some measure their distinctive characters,
the <i>Rua da Prata</i> abounding in the shops of silversmiths, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
<i>Rua Augusta</i> in tailors and linendrapers. From the <i>Rocio</i>,
besides these links with Black Horse Square, goes the steep
<i>Rua do Carmo</i>, with more fashionable shops, leading to the
<i>Chiado</i>, and on the opposite side is the great market-place
of the <i>Praça da Figueira</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Market.</div>

<p>Thither through the night carts drawn by single oxen rumble
slowly in, laden with vegetables from the country, the white
hanging street-lamps lighting up the lordly
pyramids of cabbages or turnips or tomatoes
while <i>regateiras</i> (market women, also called
<i>collarejas</i>, from Collares) carry in great baskets on their
heads, and may be seen resting at dawn on the pavement
outside the market. Indeed, it is one of the charms of
Lisbon that beneath all its cosmopolitanism it has succeeded
in retaining a certain rustic air. The servant-girl in one of
M. Anatole France’s books, who came back well pleased with
her first day in Paris: <i>elle avait vu de beaux navets</i>, would be
enchanted with Lisbon. There the flat open baskets of
vegetables balanced by men on their shoulders at either end
of a thick pole—a truly tremendous burden, but perhaps
they are <i>gallegos</i>, the porters of Lisbon, who stand cord
over shoulder at the street corners—and the brimming
panniers of donkeys give a freshness to the streets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pregões.</div>

<p>Morning and evening the milkman drives his cows through
the streets with the most melodious and delightful of chants.
Or the seller of maize bread cries his <i>broinhas
de milho quentinhas</i>. In May come the
strawberries: <i>morangos de Cintra</i>, followed
through the summer months by a legion of melon-sellers,
criers of grapes and all manner of fruit as the heat increases.
Some kind of fruit is ever to be had in plenty: in winter
handcarts of oranges and pineapples; or a man carries a
rosary of great pineapples hanging from a pole. And year in,
year out, go the <i>varinas</i>, the women of Ovar, bare-footed, with
their gold ornaments and stiffly falling skirts, crying their
fish; the sellers of newspapers; and the lotteryman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
(<i>cauteleiro</i>) with his perpetual litany of figures and his warning
that “to-morrow the wheel goes round: <i>Amanhã anda a
roda</i>.” The cries are nearly always soft and musical, very
different from the piercing street-cries of Madrid or Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lisbon in the Dead Season.</div>

<p>There comes a time, about the end of July, when Lisbon
is like Oxford in vacation. The glory is departed, and here
there is no secondary reflected splendour of
besundayed scouts to take its place. The
smart carriages and motor-cars are few and
far between, the steady flow of the well-dressed
and fashionable passing up and down the <i>Rua do Carmo</i>,
the <i>Chiado</i>, the <i>Rua Nova de Almada</i>, the <i>Rua de S. Nicolau</i>,
and the <i>Rua do Oiro</i>, dries up like the summer streams. Then
lemons and dark red <i>bilhas</i> of water are carried about the
streets, here a woman bears on her head over a kerchief of
deepest blue flowing to her waist a flat basket of long light
green water-melons, or a great mound of white and purple
grapes. Or perhaps in the sultry evening from some doorway
sounds the sluggish and persistent <i>Quem da mais, mais, mais</i>,
of the auctioneer at a long drawn-out <i>leilão</i>, as if the whole
world were ending in a slow desolate agony. It is a cry so
different from, yet as melancholy as, the <i>Ho vitrier</i> of the
itinerant glazier in some village of the French Alps in autumn
before the first heavy snows cut off its communications with
the plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chestnuts.</div>

<p>But with the autumn in Lisbon cheerfulness returns. From
Bussaco and Cascaes and Cintra, the Estoris and Buarcos
and Caldas da Rainha, from Paris and foreign
and Portuguese watering-places, come the
sun-browned <i>veraneantes</i>. There is a fresh
vigour in the streets, the first autumn violets are sold, the
chestnut-seller with his smoking baskets chants his <i>Castanhas
quentes e boas</i>. Donkeys are driven through the streets with
panniers of olives fresh from the country, and a little later
droves of turkeys stalk through the Rocio undeterred from
their leisured dignity by all the embarrassing trams and taxis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
The inner meaning of <i>castanha</i> in Portuguese is “restoration”;
violets were the emblems of Napoleon’s return from Elba:
so that everything points to the coming of King Sebastian
on one of those quiet autumn mornings when the hot sun
does not pierce till midday through the thick mists enveloping
the Tagus, and the fishing boats pass down-stream silent and
invisible. The author of <i>Costume of Portugal</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> refers to
Lisbon’s chestnut-roasters: “women who are seen at the
corner of almost every street in Lisbon. While the chestnuts
are roasting a few grains of salt are thrown over them, which
gives them a down similar to the bloom on a plumb fresh
gathered.” We may take the bloom of the plumb with
a grain of their salt, but still in the winter months women are
to be seen sitting in nearly every doorway of the humbler
streets fanning their glowing earthenware pots of shape exactly
the same as that used in illustration of the letter F (<i>Fogareiro</i>)
in João de Barros’ alphabet (1539).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern Lisbon.</div>

<p>If stress is here laid on these rustic traits as one of Lisbon’s
great attractions to the foreigner, it must not of course be
thought that it is not endowed with all the
luxuries and refinements of a great modern
city. There they all are, the good hôtels,
streets neatly paved and scrupulously clean, the comfortable
motor-cars and carriages, the tempting shop-windows, and
a good service of electric tramcars, in an endless rosary of
white and yellow. The service of motor-cars can scarcely
be called good. Most of the cars are comfortable, and some
of the drivers efficient, but the drivers of others sprawl lazily
in the <i>Rocio</i>, only waking up to charge an excessive fare, which
frightens away most people. Even if they have a taximeter,
it starts at a shilling (250 <i>réis</i>) and reaches 1,000 <i>réis</i> with a
strange rapidity. And if they have inveigled some unwary
person into becoming their fare and prey—they, of course,
consider all foreigners fair prey—he will find himself being
conveyed at breakneck pace in a totally wrong direction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Indeed, the foreigner driven furiously in a Lisbon taxi may
think that the <i>lisboeta</i> sets more value on time than on life,
but in fact their attitude to time is rather that of the <i>madrileño</i>
driver who, if asked to drive faster, will gradually slow down,
stop, get down, open the door, take off his hat, and ask if you
wished for anything. He will keep his politeness, even if you
miss your train. All the sadder is it that in Lisbon the inroad
of foreign customs tends to interfere with the pleasant dilatory
habits of the native. Few shops, for instance—one or two
chemists or booksellers at the most—have a little circle of
chairs for their clients (<i>freguezes</i>) to pass the time in leisurely
<i>cavaco</i>. But centuries of progress have failed to make
Lisbon uninteresting, so various are the ingredients of its
motley population, men of all nations, classes and religions.
<i>Saloios</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, peasants from the neighbourhood of Lisbon, are
noticeable in the streets for their short “Eton jackets” and
close-fitting trousers spreading out over the foot, and peasants
from further afield, beyond the Tagus for their immensely
wide (<i>desabado</i>) hats and their sackcloth coloured cloaks
reaching in a succession of capes to the feet. And emigrants
with their many-coloured patchwork <i>alforges</i> and their
coffin-shaped trunks haunt the quays.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glimpses of Lisbon.</div>

<p>Along the Tagus are more markets of fruits and vegetables
and fish, and vessels of every description, from the fishing-boat
to the great Atlantic liner, are continually
loading and unloading. Above and between
the masts of the boats show the many-coloured
dresses of fishwives and peasants, while a multitude
of snow-white seagulls rise and fall, rise and fall against the
turquoise blue of the river. Beyond lies Barreiro, with its
cork factories, the banks of the Tagus rise abruptly, and on
a clear day lordly Palmella (from which the <i>palmellão</i> wind
blows across the Tagus), perched on its lofty crag, gleams from
the dark <i>serra</i>. The passing traveller has, even without
landing, a magnificent view of city and harbour. But Lisbon
has many more intimate beauties which demand a longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
study, and would provide an artist with work for months
and years. Especially in winter the colouring is often very
exquisite, with tints subdued and delicate, as, for instance,
on a stormy day the grey irregular roofs with their crops of
fresh green grass seen in some steep <i>travessa</i> against the dark
indigo of the river or hills beyond; or some glimpse of ruined
Carmo or crumbling Alfama set in relief by a sky of limitless
clear blue. The old tiled roofs, warped and curving, are a
perpetual delight. Sometimes they have grass in straight
furrows between the rows of tiles like springing corn, or they
are covered by a more continuous carpet of mosses, or even
are gay with the flower of hawksweed. It depends largely
on the rain. Two or three months of continuous rain in winter
brings them to a high perfection. Summer is the great weeder
in Portugal: it robs both roofs and cobbled squares of their
pleasant green. Alfama from a distance has the look of a
tumble-down fishing-village above the Tagus. At close
quarters it is found to be an intricate maze of streets so narrow
that they never let in the sun, and a man’s stretched-out arms
touch either wall, and so steep that they are built often in the
form of stairs. Equally picturesque is the district of Santa
Catharina, on the other side of the city. The marvellously
steep streets and stairways going down from the <i>Calçada do
Combro</i> to the river are full of quaint surprises worthy of the
wynds of Edinburgh. Narrow stone staircases lead round
and down and down, apparently nowhither, small yards and
terraces struggle manfully to keep their balance as level
spaces, here and there a palm or a vine or an orange-tree gives
a touch of green. The principal descending streets are several
yards in width. Rows of bright-coloured clothes perpetually
a-drying are projected on poles from either side, and beneath
these motley banners is a succession of tiny stifling black shops.
The steps are strewn with rubbish and with cats and children
innumerable. Sometimes from a doorway comes a smell of
burnt rosemary or other scented brushwood used to light the
kitchen fire, and bringing with it <i>saudade</i> of the life in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Portuguese villages. The names of the streets are often as
quaint as the streets themselves, or were, for they disappear and
change with a dreadful frequency. One may tremble for the
<i>Travessa da Larangeira</i> (of the Orange Tree) or for the <i>Travessa
dos Fieis de Deus</i> (of the Faithful of God). How soon will
these be called the Passage of Progress and the Street of
Civilisation? But perhaps those in authority are beginning
to realise that these changes often rob the city of what is more
precious than much fine gold and can never be replaced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Village Life.</div>

<p>One need not go many leagues from Lisbon to find a look
of immemorial age about the life of the peasantry. One
might be in pre-Roman times. The peasant
in black peaked woollen cap, black shirt or
blouse and knee-breeches and woollen leggings,
walks slowly, goad in hand, in front of his ox-cart with its
spokeless wheels of solid wood, or is jolted along as he stands
against the tall crooked stakes that form the sides of the cart.
The life is often very primitive. The village will have some
kind of a dark <i>taverna</i>, where men may drink and play cards,
and the shop of the grocer who is the little god and gombeen
man of the village. His shop sells everything from hats and
shoes and brooms to cheeses and candles and wine and bread
and melons and grapes. He gives himself no airs and is always
ready to serve his customers behind the counter, but he is a
power in the land, often makes a considerable sum of money,
and becomes an usurer, or even helps to turn the scale at an
election.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisons.</div>

<p>The village will also, though it may not have a church,
almost certainly have a prison, through the bars of which the
prisoners converse with their friends or with
any passer-by, as is, indeed, the case in the
famous <i>Limoeiro</i> prison in Lisbon. The
Portuguese are unfortunately notorious for their neglect of
the prisons and for the astonishing way in which children and
hardened criminals, political and common offenders, are
herded together. And the eagerness to arrest is only equalled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
by the reluctance to provide food for the arrested. In fact,
to give a meal to prisoners is a recognised form of private
charity, and stands between them and actual starvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Festas.”</div>

<p>The villages themselves, their streets and houses, are often
miserable enough, but they are enlivened by a large number
of <i>festas</i> through the year. The pilgrimage
or <i>romaria</i> is usually to some shrine in the
hills or by the sea, and combines the character
of a profane picnic with a religious motive. The most famous
shrine is that of the <i>Bom Jesus</i>, near Braga, but every village
has its small church or hermitage to which a yearly procession
is organised. In some parts of the country the year begins
with the <i>janeiras</i>, when groups of men go from house to house
with songs special to the occasion, after the fashion of the
waits in England. This may be on New Year’s Day or five
days later on the Day of Kings. It ends, of course, with the
festivities of Christmas, which in Portugal, where the ties of
family life are strong, is observed with a peculiar devotion,
and all the rites of the yule log and other ancient customs, as
the <i>consoada</i> or odd meal to pass the time while waiting for
the midnight mass, called <i>a missa do gallo</i>. In the towns at
Christmas and at Easter the postman, the porter, the newspaper-seller,
the tradesman will send you their visiting-cards (!)
with their name and, printed beneath it the words, “<i>Deseja
boas festas a V. Exa. e sua Exma. familia</i>” (“Wishes a happy
<i>fête</i> to Your Excellency and to your most excellent family”).
In return for this you are expected at Christmas to <i>dar as
broas</i> (lit., give maize-breads—the <i>broas</i> eaten at Christmas in
the towns are yellow cakes, in which honey, egg, almond, and
orange peel predominate, and are very different from the
excellent maize bread of Minho), and at Easter <i>dar as amendoas</i>
(almonds). Between the Day of Kings and Christmas comes
a long series of feast-days and pleasant customs, such as in
autumn (on All Saints’ Day) the <i>magusto</i>, that is, a kind of
picnic in which the principal feature is the roasting and eating
of chestnuts not unaccompanied by wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. John’s Day.</div>

<p>But, above all, June is the month of rustic merriment,
with the <i>fêtes</i> of St. Antony, St. John the Baptist, and St.
Peter. Happily no attempts to dislodge these
saints from their pre-eminence in the mind
of the people have hitherto succeeded. The
eve of St. John continues to be celebrated with festivities far
more joyous and interesting than the <i>bourgeois fête</i> of Carnival,
in which the real people takes little part. (At Lisbon the
Carnival lasts not one day but many, and is marked by a good
deal of vulgarity and absence of originality. Indeed, it would
be utterly tedious but for the striking miniature peasant
costumes in which it is the custom to dress up small children.)
St. John the Baptist is the true popular patron saint of Portugal,
and around St. John’s Eve the popular fancy has woven
a rich fairy web of legend and superstition. In all the world,
says a <i>cantiga</i>, this day is celebrated—</p>

<p>In Beira<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a pine tree is pulled up, a procession going out
to the woods with drums and pipes. Then the smaller
branches are lopped off, and as a <i>galheiro</i> it is decked with
ferns and rosemary and other scented shrubs and so burnt.
When the fire has burnt down to a heap of glowing logs and
faggots children and grown persons jump over it, chanting
various rhymes to bring them health and good luck through
the year till next fire-tide. It does not seem to be the custom
to roll a stone on to the ashes, as in the South of France, where
the beard of St. John is found next morning under the stones.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>

<p class="noindent">many superstitious beliefs are also connected with this night.
Its hours between midnight and dawn are among the most
precious of all the year, and no witch who has
the least inkling of her business will waste a
single instant of them. The dews (<i>orvalhadas</i>)
then gathered have a special virtue, as also rosemary and
other herbs and water brought from the mountains and
streams. By the fountains appear enchanted Moorish maidens
combing their hair with combs of gold, and many other spirits
are abroad. It is the night, too, of the great blue thistles
or Jerusalem artichokes (<i>alcachofras</i>) and other auguries of
love. Next morning, on St. John’s Day, the sun dances at its
rising. So a Galician <i>romance</i> begins with these lines—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Even at Lisbon St. John’s night is celebrated with genuine
enthusiasm, and the dark blue flower of the artichoke abounds
in the markets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bull-fight.</div>

<p>Such a <i>fête</i> is far more popular than the bull-fight, about
which in Portugal there seems to be something a little artificial,
with none of the fierce passion that it evokes
in Spain. As a spectacular display the
Portuguese <i>touradas</i> can be very fine, and
there is no horror of killed horses, though the <i>toreador</i> himself
has been killed before now, despite the bull’s blunted horns.
The death of the well-known Portuguese bull-fighter Fernando
d’Oliveira, in Lisbon’s bull-ring at the <i>Campo Pequeno</i> on the
12th of May, 1904, caused an immense impression. A special
feature in Portugal are the <i>touradas nocturnas</i> (first introduced
in 1880), carried on by artificial light. The more spirited
among the young men looking on are keen to show their own
skill and valour in the arena, and on special occasions the
<i>toreadores</i> are of noble birth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sports.</div>

<p>Perhaps the greatest surprise of the Englishman visiting
Portugal, especially if he comes from Spain, where he may
have imbibed the false notion that the Portuguese
are an enervated and decadent
people, is to find that a considerable and
ever-growing number of Portuguese take part and interest
in sports and games—horse-racing, regattas, lawn-tennis,
football, motoring, riding, fencing, swimming. Football and
lawn-tennis are fairly common, cricket is played at Oporto,
and in spite of a vague belief that golf is played by the mad
Englishman on horseback, his object being to hit the ball and
arrive on the green before it, a golf-links is to be laid down
in the grounds of the new thermal establishment, hôtel and
casino at Estoril.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Brazileiros.”</div>

<p>In Portugal there is a small and narrowing circle of old
nobility, haughty and aloof, naturally
growing more aloof as they have seen in
recent years titles showered or money made the sole measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
of respect. Lisbon, certainly, materialistic as a South
American city, is at the feet of the first <i>brazileiro</i> who
returns rich to his native land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oporto.</div>

<p>At Oporto, too, although the atmosphere is totally different
from that of Lisbon, the enriched <i>brazileiro</i> plays a great part.
It is, of course, principally a business city,
and has something grim and forbidding, a
reserve foreign to Lisbon. The large number
of English wine merchants and its communications by sea
prevent it, however, from being a typical Portuguese city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Braga.</div>

<p>This is reserved for Braga in the north, which retains a
peculiar old-world flavour, and where probably there are
not more than half-a-dozen foreigners. As
most towns in Portugal, it is a steep city on
a hill, its streets of houses of many-coloured
<i>azulejos</i>, tiles, and washes, going up precipitously to the
splendid old cathedral. The inhabitants are conservative
as mountaineers, and it has the reputation of being a stronghold
of the reactionaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">North and South.</div>

<p>The outlook on life in the North and in the South of Portugal
seems often, indeed, poles asunder, the North conservative,
reserved, slow; the South more expansive,
liberal, and socialist, and the inhabitants
of Minho will look upon the inhabitant of
Algarve as little less of a stranger than the Frenchman or the
Spaniard, indeed more of a stranger than his northern neighbour
of Galicia. The inhabitants of the North are certainly
more independent: in the South, and especially in all the
district round Lisbon, political intrigue and office-hunting, and
invasion of foreigners, have had a bad influence on character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Begging.</div>

<p>Perhaps in no region on earth is begging more general. It
is not only the <i>lamuria</i>, the woeful <i>ladainhas</i> of the beggars
in the streets and on the roads, with their
strange tales or worn pieces of paper telling
of “disastrous chances” and “moving accidents,”
in spelling still more disastrous. You may say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
you have no money to give or that you will not give it, but
that will not move them. The shibboleth to get rid of them is
<i>Tenha paciencia</i> (Have patience: the very last thing they
require), which corresponds in effectiveness to the <i>Perdone
Vd. por Dios</i>, the pardon asked in the name of God of Spanish
beggars for giving them nothing. It means presumably that
you have a hardened and obdurate heart, that you have heard
it all before, and are up to all their tricks and devices: at
least they immediately depart with gently muttered imprecations.
These unfortunate persons are from time to time
swept up promiscuously, the knaves and the deserving, by
the police, and shut up in the worst cells of the Lisbon prisons
till they can be shipped overseas with far less care or concern
than a cargo of frozen meat. Meanwhile their <i>confrères</i> in
higher grades of society continue in their no less degrading
mendicity: for an official post, a trade concession, a favourable
verdict in the law-courts, a this, a that, sinecures and
trifles, in an endless intrigue to <i>arranjar</i> whatever necessity
or ambition demands at the hands of friends, Government
officials, deputies, politicians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Officials.</div>

<p>And the number of Government officials is enormous and
increases. It is the object of all to attain this dignity. For the
higher posts a University degree is a help,
and many go to Coimbra solely with this
object in view. (In the seventeenth century,
according to the <i>Arte de Furtar</i> (1652), over a hundred
“students” yearly succeeded in taking their degree at
Coimbra in order to obtain government employment without
ever having been in Coimbra.) But even the <i>cantoneiro</i>,
who receives something under a shilling from the State
to mend or omit to mend the roads of Portugal, thereby
rises a step in the social scale and, if he starves, starves
with authority. It is the duty of a political leader to provide
places high and low for as large a number of followers
as possible: herein will be gauged the measure of his success.
There is thus continually a great moral (or immoral)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
force persistently at work to overthrow the existing Government,
which is like a solitary batsman with not only the
bowler—the legitimate Opposition—against him, but the
whole field and all the spectators (hostile or indifferent).
For the Portuguese are like the frogs, never content until
King Log has been replaced by King Stork, and not very
content then. For them the bird in the hand is never half
so fine as the two in the bush, and they go on intriguing,
insinuating, imagining <i>novidades</i> and betterment, both in
private and public life, forgetful of their own proverb, <i>Do mal
o menos</i> (Let sleeping dogs lie). Politics sometimes causes
disturbances at Coimbra. The University, formerly Liberal,
has now become Conservative, “reactionary” in its dislike
of the methods of the “White Ants.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coimbra University.</div>

<p>This, the only Portuguese University, answering to Oxford
and Cambridge, and old as they, is built on a hill in a delightful
position above the Mondego, perhaps the most
beautiful of Portugal’s many beautiful rivers,
flowing through a country lovely in itself and
endeared to all Portuguese by its traditions of history and
legend, of which a great book might be filled. The teaching
at Coimbra is apt to be too theoretical and to embrace too
many fields, to the loss of exact scholarship. Many attend
the lectures and rarely open a book. Literary discussions are
frequent unless momentarily submerged by politics, and of
course much ingenuity is always expended on skit and <i>troça</i>
and epigram. Actual book-learning and accurate study of
texts are less in favour (especially among the <i>cabulas</i> or
<i>calaceiros</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, students whose mission in life is to take the
key of the fields). Rows between town (<i>futricas</i>) and gown
are not unknown. The undergraduates are divided into
<i>caloiros</i> (<i>becjaune</i>, fledgling, fresher), <i>novatos</i> and <i>veteranos</i>,
and live in considerable freedom, in lodgings or hôtels,
or clubbing together in <i>republicas</i> composed of a few
students often from the same province, <i>algarvios</i>, <i>minhotos</i>,
<i>beirões</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Regional Variety.</div>

<p>Thus even here are maintained those distinctions between
region and region, which form no little part of the attraction
of Portugal for the traveller. Scarcely for
the traveller in trains: if anyone wishes to
write a valuable and delightful book on Spain
and Portugal, let his travels be with a donkey, or on foot,
selling, say, saffron or images of saints, and he will be amply
rewarded for whatever little discomforts he may have to
endure. The dress and gold ornaments of the peasant women
of the North have been often described, and if Minho deserved
visiting for nothing else it would be worth while to go there
in order to see some out-of-the-way village <i>praça</i> (consisting
often of the high road) on a market day gleaming with gold,
if not purple, more than all the cohorts of Sennacherib. Some
of the women are entirely covered with necklaces from neck
almost to the waist, and wear one or more pairs of earrings
often several inches in length. But even the <i>boeirinha</i>, the
little ox-girl who goes dressed in scarlet and gold with her
huge goad in front of the oxen, will have her gold ornament.
It is in the North that the oxen wear on their heads those
strange erections, often beautifully carved, called <i>cangas</i>.
In Minho, too, chiefly survives the use of the cloak of reeds—<i>coroça</i>—which,
according to the author of <i>Costume of Portugal</i>,
was adopted by certain English officers who had seen it in
Portugal nearly a century ago, and admired its convenience and
capacity for keeping out the rain, which runs off it as water
from a duck’s back: a useful property in a country like Portugal,
where the autumn, winter, and spring rains are often
heavy and sometimes continuous. For the Portuguese, except
for some districts of Traz os Montes and Beira, winter consists
of rain, not cold, and the rain at most develops a suspicion of
sleet (<i>chuva branca</i>). But as a rule that good sun of Portugal,
which has the property of warming without burning, is ever
lurking round the corner, ready to appear on the first pretext.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shepherds.</div>

<p>A familiar sight in Alemtejo and the <i>Serra da Estrella</i> are
the shepherds, the <i>rabadãos</i> and <i>zagaes</i>, dressed in brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
fleeces, with their huge umbrellas of faded blue slung across
their shoulders. The late Conde de Ficalho, in the first
volume of <i>A Tradição</i> (1899), described in
an interesting paper the shepherds of
Alemtejo, living a nomad life from pasture to
pasture, after the fashion of the Arabs, transferring their
clothes and food and implements on donkeys, as in Gil Vicente.
Many of the words they use are of Arabic origin, as <i>alfeire</i>
(a flock of young lambs) or the <i>alfirme</i> used to tie the sheep’s
legs for the shearing. They wear a <i>pellico</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a great jacket
of fleeces sewn together with <i>corriol</i> (strips of leather) or a
<i>çamarro</i>, which consists merely of two fleeces without sleeves.
The shepherd earns a small salary (<i>soldada</i>) and his food
(<i>comedia</i>), and has certain sheep of his own (his <i>pegulhal</i>).
The shepherds of the <i>Serra da Estrella</i> are more stationary.
Sun and wind have fanned and tanned them till they sometimes
resemble nothing so much as an old dead tree-trunk
scarred by lightning, and they may be seen standing motionless
as a tree hour after hour in the bare <i>Serra</i>. They are as
remote from the twentieth century as are the days of Romulus
and Remus, and their customs and those of the quaint villages
set in the deep ravines of the <i>Serra</i> are worth a careful study,
belonging as they do to an age long past, before civilisation
sweeps them away. Read or write the inhabitants cannot,
books and newspapers are unknown; but they maintain
an old-world courtesy and dignity of bearing which are
attractive. They constitute one of the most characteristic
parts of the Portuguese people, one of the most interesting
elements in the infinite variety of Portuguese life.</p>

<span class="smaller">RELIGION AND EDUCATION</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Anti-clericalism.</div>

<p>“To persecute is to propagate,” said one of the greatest
modern Portuguese, Alexandre Herculano, and a Lisbon
newspaper, <i>O Diario de Noticias</i> (22nd March,
1901), could declare that “toleration in
matters of religion has with us been almost
unbroken.” The anti-clerical agitation in Portugal in the
year 1901 was for the most part an artificial echo of the
agitation in Spain (the year of Pérez Galdós’ <i>Electra</i>), encouraged
for political purposes. Popular demonstrations were
organised and cheers raised for Liberty, Democracy, and
Snr. Manoel da Arriaga (subsequently the first President of the
Republic). On the 10th of March the Civil Governors were
ordered to inquire whether any religious houses existed under
illegal conditions, that is, contrary to the <i>Concordat</i> between
Portugal and the Vatican. Properly, in view of the law of
May, 1834, only the religious orders concerned with education,
charity, nursing, and foreign missions had the right to exist.
On the 11th of March fresh disturbances occurred, and on the
13th a decree was published ordering the inspection of those
religious houses which could show their title to exist and the
closure of all others. But there was in reality no “religious
question” in Portugal, no comparison with the situation in
France and Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Religious Orders.</div>

<p>The religious congregations took no part in industry nor
did they evade the taxes (these are the two chief popular
charges against them in Spain). On the
other hand, they did much good work among
the poor, and performed useful service in
education. To many their sudden expulsion may seem a
foolish and brutal measure. But France had banished the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
congregations, and those Portuguese politicians who model
their actions on those of France must follow suit without
inquiring whether the action of France in this respect had been
wise or its results beneficial, or whether the conditions in
France and Portugal were identical. Henry VIII of England
abolished the monasteries because they were rich, and the
fabulous wealth attributed to the religious houses no doubt
largely inspired the modern cry of anti-clericalism. What
must have been the disappointment when the wealth of some
of the Portuguese congregations was found to consist of nothing
but a few musty and worm-eaten volumes. Had the same
arbitrary measures been adopted against a literary or industrial
association, there would have been an outcry throughout
the world at the tyranny or injustice: but these were only
poor religious, men and women who had deliberately chosen
to lead that kind of life, in many ways an ideal life in Portugal.
Why happiness thus attained by a few should be so obnoxious
to the modern politician is one of the mysteries of progress.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But the religious orders will return to Portugal, and those
beautifully situated and beautifully built convents once more
fulfil their proper purpose. Or, if they do not return, almost
certainly in the course of time groups of men and women will
separate themselves from society and live a philosophical life
apart—religious orders under another name. If they can
combine philosophy, literature, and art with manual labour
the expulsion of the original orders will not have been in vain.
We shall have the Order of Carpenters and Musicians at
Belem, of Cobblers and Sculptors at Alcobaça, of Philosophers
and Tailors at Batalha, of Painters and Ploughmen at Thomar,
of Poets and Foresters at Bussaco, and so on. It was easy
for demagogues to persuade the people, in whose eyes <i>omne
ignotum pro—malefico</i>, that dreadful crimes were committed
behind convent walls, just as the uneducated Russian believes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
that the Jews sacrifice Christian children, and the expulsion
of the religious orders figured as the most prominent item on
the programme of the Republicans, and was put into practice
immediately after the Revolution of 1910.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jesuits.</div>

<p>Considering the great services of monks and nuns in education,
in nursing, and in the Portuguese possessions overseas,
the only fair course in Portugal would have
been at the most to banish the Jesuits, if
their action was thought to be political, and
any congregations that had emigrated to Portugal after their
expulsion from France. For the rest, they could be undermined
slowly by education: obviously if no new members
were found willing to profess they would come to an end of
their own accord. The Jesuits, whom half-educated Republicans,
knowing very little about them, believe to be peculiarly
maleficent and satanic, were not very numerous in Portugal.
In the beginning of 1909 there were only 355 as compared with
3,002 in Spain. In the beginning of 1910 there were in
Portugal 387 (161 priests, 123 coadjutors, and 103 students).
It may or may not have been expedient to expel them, but
in any case they stood upon a different footing from that of
the other religious houses, whose sudden expulsion brought
consternation and misery to many a village. But the action
of the reformers did not stop here: it was extended to the
secular clergy, and seemed to be directed against the very
existence of religion. The precept of <i>O Seculo</i> a few years
earlier (11th March, 1901) was forgotten: “It is necessary
not to confuse the religion of the State with Jesuitism, our
regular clergy with the Jesuits.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clergy and People.</div>

<p>Portugal had been fortunate in possessing an enlightened
clergy. Many priests were liberal in politics, and only a few
of them—in some remote parts of the country—were
fanatics. The mass of the people is
equally unfanatic. But only a section of the
population of a single city—Lisbon—is non-Catholic. Indeed,
according to one computation, there are only six thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
non-Catholics in Portugal, or one in every thousand inhabitants.
To the mass of the people religion is a pleasant show,
and a refuge from the grinding reality of their lives, the Church
ceremonies, the processions and pilgrimages are the notes of
holiday and gaiety in the villages.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> To the educated it was
part of the glorious traditions of Portugal’s past, ever intimately
connected with religion (<i>fé e imperio.</i> Camões, <i>Lusiads</i>, I, 2),
so that the extreme anti-clerical who carries his creed to the
length of striking at the root and existence of religion will,
if he is logical, look askance at those Portuguese heroes who
fought in Portugal and in India in the name of Santiago, and at
the most magnificent old buildings in Portugal. The cry of
anti-clericalism in Portugal has proved itself in the Spanish
phrase a <i>necedad de siete capas</i>—seven times foolishness. It
is not in any sense national, but has been imported bodily
from abroad. Senhor Teixeira de Sousa, the last Premier of
the Monarchy, said in an interview to a correspondent of
<i>Le Matin</i>: “La question cléricale ne se pose pas ici comme
en Espagne, car le peuple portugais n’est pas clérical.” So
the Republican <i>Intransigente</i> could say later (31st December,
1911): “There was no religious question in the country, and
now the religious question, provoked by certain measures of
a secondary character and by the so-called Law of Separation
between Church and State, rises over the country like a menace
of civil war.” And the anti-clerical <i>Mundo</i> itself admitted
(9th March, 1914) that the religious question in Portugal
“has never had the serious aspect which it has had in other
nations.... If recently the religious question has begun to
make itself felt that is due to the deference of certain persons
who call themselves Republicans to clerical pretensions.”
Thus the religious question, having been provoked by anti-clericalism,
was to receive a homoeopathic remedy—more
anti-clericalism. Gambetta had exclaimed, “<i>Le Cléricalisme,
voilà l’ennemi</i>,” and Portuguese politicians had adopted this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
cry from Paris. In the public schools religion has been forbidden
by law, in the private it has only been given at the
expense of denunciation and persecution. When it is remembered
that in many parishes the priests have been deprived
of all authority, it will be seen how little chance there is of the
children receiving any religious instruction. Portuguese
Democrats if they have ever heard of Cecil Rhodes probably
know that he was no reactionary. It is worth quoting his
words: “Their school years are the years in which to tell the
children that there is one thing better than material instruction,
and that is religious belief.” But in Portugal now
thousands of children are being brought up to regard material
prosperity as the only good. There is no God but Gold, and
the Republic is its prophet. The new narrow system of
education may turn out shrewd, materialistic, tram-and-asphalt
citizens, but in a larger sense and in the long run
Portugal is likely to suffer. It may be found when it is too
late that the <i>cera branda</i> has been moulded to ill purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Law of Separation (1911).</div>

<p>The Law of Separation between Church and State was
drawn up by Dr. Affonso Costa as Minister of Justice (20th
April, 1911). It is a long document of 196
clauses, closely following French models or
modifying them in a still more anti-clerical
direction. Yet there were many considerations
which should have given extreme anti-clericalism pause
in Portugal. With a clergy not in principle opposed to the
Republic, it might have been possible to come to an excellent
working compromise. Many of the priests even acquiesce in
the principle of separation between Church and State, but
Dr. Costa’s law, they complain, while pretending to separate
Church from State, in reality subjugates the Church to a
hostile State. And it is not the priests only who say it.
“The decree of 20th April, 1911,” says <i>A Republica</i> (13th
March, 1914), “affected to separate the Churches from the
State, but did nothing but subject the Catholic Church to
the intervention of the Republic.” These are the words of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
an extremely Republican paper. The priests by this Law
must either receive State pensions or starve; their authority
has been replaced by that of the public worship associations,
often organised by persons hostile to religion. They are
deprived of the possession of the churches, and even of the
bishops’ and priests’ houses, even of the libraries carefully
added to by successive bishops. They are not allowed to
wear clerical dress. The authority of the higher ecclesiastics
is carefully undermined, and the bishops are not permitted
even to issue a pastoral letter without previous censorship of
the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Processions.</div>

<p>These and other real grievances as well as many petty
restrictions, such as the prohibition of processions, of services
and ringing of bells between sunrise and
sunset, mark a narrow spirit which has made
it impossible for the whole of the North of
Portugal to sympathise with the Republic. Dr. Costa has
been the Royalists’ great asset. “Oh, but there is no such
prohibition,” say the Democrats; “the law does not forbid
processions.” It contents itself with rendering them impossible.
Clause 57 runs: “Ceremonies, processions, and other
external manifestations of religion will only be permitted
where and in so far as they are an inveterate custom of the
majority of the citizens of a district, and must be immediately
and definitely forbidden in places where the faithful or other
persons without a protest on their part make the processions
an occasion for provoking tumults and disturbances of public
order.” Thus the procedure is simple. You have only to
throw a stone at a priest or other person in a procession. If
the faithful protest there is a tumult, if they fail to protest
there has been a disturbance of public order. The procession is
henceforth forbidden. Yet to deprive the people of these
simple pleasures is a kind of sacrilege. In the remote villages
they have few others. Those who know to what an extent
in Latin countries these ceremonies partake of a secular as
well as a religious character realise the sadness which descends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
upon a village when docked of its processions. They are the
villager’s theatre as well as his prayer book. The men, it is
true, can substitute the tavern, and the women do not count.
Let them stay in their black kitchens, often as dirty and
airless as the taverns, and mind their pots and their pans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Religious Revival.</div>

<p>That the Republic could be so blind to its own interests as
to adopt these Jacobin courses would be strange indeed, were
it not that evidently the interests of a party
had been preferred to those of the Republic.
Recently (<i>i.e.</i>, before 14th May, 1915) a far
more moderate attitude and methods more conciliatory have
been adopted, but in the question of religion fresh legislation,
as well as a new spirit, will be required. All men of sense,
from the President, Dr. Arriaga, downwards, recognise that the
Law of Separation will have to be altered in a more moderate
direction. In this connection <i>A Republica</i> (6th March, 1914)
used the following words, in connection with the Amnesty
of 1914: “To grant an amnesty to priests who have acted
illegally because their religious conscience bade them oppose
certain clauses in the Law of Separation is merely to say to
these priests, ‘You leave prison to-day in order to come back
to it to-morrow.’” When Dr. Affonso Costa became Prime
Minister in 1913 revision of this law was promised, but during
his year of office it was not revised. Under his successor,
Dr. Bernardino Machado, discussion of the Law began, but
still it was not revised. Its revision would, however, be
assured, were it realised that the Republic by violent anti-clericalism
is defeating its own objects. For—not to mention
the wholesome discipline of the Roman Catholic Church and
its democratic tendency—such anti-clericalism is in danger
of driving moderate Roman Catholics into something like
fanaticism and of creating a religious revival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illiterates.</div>

<p>The census of 1911 gives the number of illiterates in Portugal
as 75·1 per cent. of the entire population (men, 68·4 per cent.;
women, 81·2), and this at least is not the fault of the priests,
since religion was taken out of their hands in 1834. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
extraordinary figure of 75·1 includes small children; excluding
children under seven the figures are 69·7 (men, 60·8; women,
77·4). The progress has been slow in the
last twenty years. In 1890 the total percentage
of illiterates was 79·2 per cent. (1,762,842
men and 2,238,115 women). In 1900 it was 78·6 (1,855,091
men and 2,406,245 women). In 1911 the number of men who
cannot read or write was 1,936,131, and of women 2,541,947;
or, excluding children under seven, 1,370,571 men, 1,989,906
women. The Republic was ushered in with pompous phrases
concerning education. In a few years there were to be no
more illiterates, in a few years there was to be a school to
every two <i>kilomètres</i> throughout the country. But there has
been danger of more attention being given to the show than
to the substance of reform, and of education becoming more
and more a whited sepulchre. Yet apart from mistakes made
and hollow promises put forward for foreign consumption,
but quite meaningless in Portugal, one must admit that the
Republicans realise the importance of education and have a
sincere desire to diminish the number of illiterates (as though
that in itself were a great gain!), and may hope that their
efforts in the matter of education will be more successful in
future than they have been in the past. The institution of
night schools and itinerant masters is no doubt a step in the
right direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primary Schools.</div>

<p>The method adopted has been to draw up ideally excellent
decrees, and the hope is presumably that they will gradually
work down into touch with the facts of Portuguese
life. Meanwhile they tend to remain
mere pieces of paper. The decree of 29th
March, 1911, reforming primary education is little more.
Primary education was transferred from the control of the
State to that of the local authorities, which tend to neglect it
altogether. The failure of the <i>municipios</i> to pay the schoolmasters
had been already manifest when primary instruction
was entrusted to them in 1881, and they were empowered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
levy a special tax for the purpose. The law of 1911 made education
compulsory and neutral in the matter of religion. It had
been compulsory since 1878, with the results already described.
The Republicans boast that they have created a large number
of schools, over 900 primary schools in three years, but in
reality it would have been better to see to an improvement in
the condition of the 6,000 existing schools, and to the payment
of the schoolmasters’ salaries. The foundation of a school in
Portugal is a very simple affair, almost as simple as the issuing
of a decree. It consists in fixing on a room or a house in a
village which might be used for that purpose and—there the
matter generally ends. Neither books nor furniture nor
masters are provided, and that not from any carelessness or
indifference but because there is no money to pay for them.
Thus, Snr. Antonio Macieira, Minister for Foreign Affairs in
Dr. Costa’s Government, declared in a speech made on 28th
March, 1913, that to replace the 115 schools of the expelled
religious congregations the Republic had created 991 new
schools. Of these 991, he continued blandly to state, 556
were non-existent. The Monarchy had not neglected education,
even though it cannot claim to have founded schools at
the rate of half-a-dozen a week. In 1772 the number of
primary schools was 526, and rose to 720 fifty years later.
Between 1839 and 1868 new schools were created to the
number of 1,422, and in the next thirteen years 965, so that
in 1881 the total stood at 4,472, with some 200,000 school-children.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In 1900 the schools were 4,520; at the end of
1906 there were 5,226, or about one per thousand inhabitants.
The pity was that they were for the most part in hired unhealthy
buildings, and that the ill-paid or unpaid schoolmasters
taught as badly as they were paid. Other decrees concerning
education were more practical, as that of 1905 insisting on
physical drill in the schools, or that of 1907 assigning a
hundred <i>contos</i> a year to send students abroad. As to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
condition of the school-buildings, even in Lisbon, says a Republican
paper (<i>A Republica</i>, 17th April, 1914), “there are State
schools in small flats in the midst of the deafening noise of the
street, without light, without air, without hygiene, without
anything to attract the miserable children who attend
them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minister of Education.</div>

<p>The Republic has founded a Department of Public Instruction
with a new Minister and all the subordinate officials.
Dr. Theophilo Braga at the time gave it as
his opinion that it would only serve to provide
posts for half-a-dozen political friends of the
Government—<i>anichar meia duzia de amigos politicos</i>. The
department existed in 1870 and again in 1890. In both
cases it proved expensive and unsatisfactory, and was chiefly
notable for giving further scope to <i>empregomania</i> and bureaucracy,
more than 600 candidates applying for posts in 1890.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Snr. Machado notes the <i>despesas de installação</i> of the new
department and its <i>esperança a toda a gente</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, it spread
hope far and wide not of an improvement in education but of
a new chance of becoming a Government official.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is true
that in the past sums contributed by local administrative
bodies to the State for the purpose of education, sent by them
to the Department of the Interior which embraced that of
Education, were not infrequently diverted to the more pressing
needs of the Government and spent on something
quite unconnected with education. In future, at least,
they will be spent on maintaining the new Department of
Education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of the People.</div>

<p>Education in Portugal is of three kinds: primary, secondary
(in <i>lycées</i>, in the capital of each district, with two at Oporto
and three at Lisbon), and the University
education of Coimbra. Primary education
has been compulsory for the last generation,
yet four and a half million out of six million inhabitants cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
write or read. There is indeed little inducement for the
peasants to send their children to school, and considerable
inducement to keep them at home where they can be useful
in the fields. In a land of few industries, where a large
majority of the inhabitants live by agriculture and fishing,
there is but little need of book-learning, nor is there any
universal book to be found in peasants’ houses, as the Bible
in England. Moreover, the peasants distrust education, and
distrust it the more the more it is mixed up with politics
and questions of religion. And if illiterates are disfranchised
they look upon that rather as a blessing than a penalty,
being desirous to have as little to do with politics as may be.
Some of the children are quite keen to learn, and after being
kept at work all day willingly attend night classes; but there
is many a family in which the parents not only do not encourage
their children to learn to write and read, but deliberately
forbid it, considering that the drawbacks of education exceed
its advantages. The Republic is credited with the project of
providing all the children at the primary schools with food
and clothes. It may be wondered what the ill-paid schoolmasters
would say to this—probably they would go on strike
until they were given clothes and food too—but the children
would certainly flock to school, as indeed they often do now,
without therefore necessarily learning to write or read.
<i>Para que serve saber ler?</i> What use is it? That is the question
which the peasant children learn from their parents,
who, it is to be feared, do not pay all the respect that were to
be desired to Lisbon’s crowding politicians. Perhaps, too,
in their native good sense, they consider the pale and sickly
Lisbon school children who on the shortest provocation will
rattle you off a fable of La Fontaine in French or talk of the
eclipses or the equinox, or the scientific reason for the colour
of sunsets, or other high matters of which you know nothing
and which to them are mere abstractions, while they do not
know the difference between an ash and an oak. Of Portuguese
as it should be spoken, of Portuguese literature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
history and geography they are more ignorant. Yet before
learning French or English they should surely be taught
Portuguese—the direct and forcible Portuguese of the early
prose-writers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aged Children.</div>

<p>In Portugal, and especially in the towns, the children are
for the most part too serious and precocious and sad. This
seems to be encouraged; they are willingly
taken to funerals or marshalled in thousands
to attend political demonstrations. It was
even proposed recently, on the occasion of the death-sentence
in the English law-courts of a Portuguese who had murdered
his wife, that all the school-children, pompously lectured on
the duties of humanity, should sign a petition to the King of
England on his behalf. Thus they are doctors at ten—<i>docteurs
à dix [ans]</i>—in Montaigne’s phrase and die of old age
before they are twenty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lycées.</div>

<p>The theoretical character of the education provided is
especially noticeable in the <i>lycées</i>. This <i>ensino secundario</i>
is described by a master in July, 1913, as
consisting of “immense disconnected programmes.”
It overloads the pupil’s mind,
and stuffs him with abstractions. Far from diminishing, it
increases his natural vagueness and teaches him to approach
Portugal by way of China or Japan and mankind through
that wicked abstraction, Humanity. Freedom and Happiness,
too, fade away into abstract ideals to be intrigued and
fought for, perhaps, but scarcely to be enjoyed in common
life. Yet it is as true now as when Blake wrote the words
that “Those who want Happiness must stoop [not soar] to
find it: it is a flower that grows in every vale.” It is as
true now, in spite of all the changed conditions, as when
Goethe said it, that “If a man has enough Freedom to live a
healthy life and carry on his work, it should suffice him, and
so much freedom anyone can easily attain.” The number of
those who matriculated at the <i>lycées</i> throughout the country
is given for 1907-8 as 6,947, including 1,845 at the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Lisbon <i>lycées</i>, 802 at the two Oporto <i>lycées</i>, 630 at Coimbra,
343 at Braga, 310 at Vizeu, 181 at Evora.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">University Degrees.</div>

<p>The University of Coimbra has the advantage of attracting
scholars from all Portugal and of thus being Portugal’s factory
of ideas and future politicians. The practical
object of the undergraduates is to become
lawyers, journalists, politicians, Government
officials. To be addressed for the rest of their lives as <i>Senhor
Doutor</i> (<i>bacharel</i>, <i>licenciado</i>, <i>doutor</i>) appeals to their vanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Liberal Profession.</div>

<p>The result is that all these liberal professions are overcrowded
and so unremunerative that it is necessary for one
person to combine two or three professions;
to be for instance, journalist, advocate, and
leader of a party, or journalist, doctor, and
Minister of Finance. The number of applicants for every
post makes it possible, moreover, for the Government to leave
the officials unpaid: others will be only too willing to succeed
them should they rebel. Every Government department,
and indeed every liberal profession, is overstaffed. “In
nearly every service there is an army of supernumeraries,
many of whom merely receive a salary without doing any
work, the public department to which they belong not even
knowing their address. Yet when a post becomes vacant
a new official is appointed, the supernumeraries continuing
as before” (<i>O Seculo</i>, 7th December, 1912). The first years
after a revolution were unlikely to bring any change: “Republican
Ministers seem to have considered matters of administration
too insignificant to notice.... New expenses
have been created, the action of the public departments
extended with lamentable rapidity, and no check has been set,
as was urgently required, on the system of promotions and
the growth of the bureaucracy” (<i>O Seculo</i>, 3rd December,
1912).</p>

<p>The Department of Public Works has an army of architects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
and other officials, but when some public work crops up a
foreign engineer is usually called in. The Department resembles
a river which dries up before reaching the region that
required irrigation or that army sent by Philip XII of France
against Spain, which had dwindled away before crossing the
Bidasoa. In the same way it was complained in Portugal a
few years ago that there were “too many canons” (<i>O Diario
de Noticias</i>, January, 1902). In the same way it is complained
to-day that there are too many officers. The sum
of 1,535 contos, over a sixth of the whole military estimates,
was devoted to the retired list in the Budget of 1913-4. The
average of officers is, roughly, one to nine men. “Our officers
would suffice for an army as large as that of Germany”
(<i>O Diario de Noticias</i>, 11th February, 1902). (In the Engineers
there are 145 officers to 1,075 men, in the Artillery 368 to
2,610 men, in the Cavalry 263 to 1,837, in the Infantry 1,291
to 12,289 men.) (<i>A Republica</i>, 26th March, 1913). It has
been suggested that a thousand officers would be sufficient,
and that the other thousand should be employed as mayors,
a course also proposed in 1893. And in the same way there
are too many journalists, too many politicians. Some
attempts have been made to get back to reality, and several
technical schools, for instance, are in existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Francezismo.”</div>

<p>The same lack of funds which fetters the schools prevents
the libraries of Lisbon, Oporto, Coimbra, Evora, and Braga
from being kept up to date. But for these
difficulties, the material to the teacher’s hand
is promising enough, for the people, if it can
be persuaded that it is to its advantage, is quick and eager to
learn. The attempts, however, to dissociate the teaching
from all the traditions of Portugal is bound to be a failure.
The trouble already is that the Portuguese are too much
inclined to be cosmopolitan, and what is required is a development
of that part of the Portuguese people still untainted with
<i>francezismo</i> along strictly national lines. The lament of the
novelist Eça de Queiroz is well known. Accused of Gallicism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in his work, he retorted: “Scarcely was I born when I began
to breathe a French atmosphere. France was all around me.”
The atmosphere of his home was continued in French text-books,
at Coimbra. At Lisbon, “in theatres and shops and
cookery there was nothing left of Portugal: there was nothing
but cheap imitations of France.” And especially was this
true in politics: a small group of Frenchified persons ruled
Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In the last half-century this Frenchification has
only increased in Portugal. “Portugal is a country translated
from the French into slang,” said Eça de Queiroz on the same
occasion, in an essay published after his death. Fortunately
this is an exaggeration, and a symptom of the disease that a
Portuguese should thus mistake Coimbra and Lisbon for
Portugal. “Outside Lisbon,” he declared, “there is neither
intellectual nor social life,” and this may be deplorable but
it is of good augury for the future. Not Portugal but Lisbon
is “translated from the French.” The <i>francezismo</i> has not
yet extended to the mass of the people, and it is therefore of
the utmost importance that it should not be denationalized
by French text-books, French laws, French customs. At the
root of this <i>francezismo</i> lies the love of progress which has
always characterised the Portuguese, but the truest progress
at present will surely consist in going back to Portugal’s past,
to the study of the land of Portugal, of her history, as rich
as that of any other country in striking episodes and personalities,
and of her literature, in which the glories of that history
are reflected.</p>

<span class="smaller">A LAND OF FLOWERS</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Estoril and Cintra.</div>

<p>It is a land of roses flowering in December, a land where, in
the words of Garrett, “oranges glow in the orchards and
myrtle blooms on the moors: <i>Onde a laranjeira
cresce na horta e o matto é de murta</i>”
(<i>Viajens na minha terra</i>, 1846). The foreigner
who spends a few days in Portugal and sees perhaps Cintra
and Estoril may think that he has been offered a few show
pieces, yet everywhere in this wonderful climate, a warmer
South-west of Ireland, given water and shelter either from the
sea or from the subtle Spanish wind, plants thrive and grow
as swiftly almost as the fabled bean-stalk, and flowers cover the
ground like mushrooms in the twinkling of a fairy’s eye.
A desolate strip of coast near Lisbon, apparently grey and
barren, mere sunburnt and spray-beaten rock, was found on
closer acquaintance to have at various seasons of the year,
among other flowers, whin and cistus, yellow jonquil, white
clustered jonquil, celandine, crocus, light blue dwarf iris,
large dark-blue iris, mint and sea-lavender. And Cintra
possesses many lovely places unknown to tourists, the whole
region deserving not the stay of a few hours but a quiet
sojourn in one of its houses or hôtels. The slopes of the <i>Serra</i>
looking towards Cascaes, though rarely visited, are scarcely less
beautiful than those above the village of Cintra, and are
crowded with all kinds of trees and flowers. You may walk
across from Estoril. The path goes haphazard through the
uncultivated <i>matto</i> and then a road, also through <i>matto</i>
moorland, passing an occasional village with low one-storeyed
houses and lanes between walls of loose stones covered with
brambles, sarsaparilla, and eglantine. Here a woman in white
blouse, yellow skirt, and plum-coloured kerchief is at work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
in a small plot of vines; there a boy keeping donkeys and
black-and-white cows is dressed all in light faded greys and
blues like one of the wayside thistles. The country has a
look of Dartmoor—only that there is no water, no patches of
vivid treacherous green—and in front rise the twenty odd tors
of the <i>Serra</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ribeira de Pena Longa.</div>

<p>At the foot of the <i>Serra</i> is Ribeira de Pena Longa, a little
tumble-down village in olives and fruit-trees, with a few
clumps of mighty planes. The village street
is mainly of rock with loose stones, evidently
a torrent in winter, and the forlorn and
poverty-stricken look of the whole village will amaze the
Englishman accustomed to see the flourishing condition of
villages near or on some great estate in England. There are
a few iron balconies with tins of carnations, and grey ruined
walls of houses with olives and vines growing between them
seem to tell of a more prosperous past, perhaps when the
neighbouring Convent of Pena Longa was wont to receive
the visits of King João III. From the village a wide gate
leads into a kind of mysterious fairyland: out of the glowing
sunshine the road passes to a cool shaded avenue of arched
trees, where the songs of birds are heard in number and variety
rare in Latin countries. A rapid stream runs by the road,
and on this side and on that are a multitude of fruit trees
and great myrtle hedges, twenty-feet high cactus with their
large deep-orange-coloured flowers, giant-leaved bananas,
vine-trellises, groves of lemons, plots gay with garden flowers.
It is an enchanted country, and presently you will come to
many peacocks and the low rambling house of the Viscondes
de Pena Longa. At the other end the estate is bounded by
the <i>serra</i> of pines and eucalyptus. A little further on a small
lake is fringed with great pines, and here is a marvellous
solemn silence scarcely broken by the distant cooing of
doves or the sound of running water. Among the pines grows
bracken and heather, myrtles in massed snow-white flower, and
thick tufts of the dark purple lavender. Thence with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
difficulty you may climb through a dense wood of every
variety of tree and labyrinthine paths up to the palace of Pena.
Fuchsias and bays and many a scented shrub and flowering
tree will recompense you for the pains of the ascent, and
goodly views of the Tagus, and of the <i>Serra d’Ossa</i> in Alemtejo.
There are masses of periwinkles, and many an old wall
a-crumble fretted with maidenhair and that variety of daisy
which loves old mellow stonework, be it that of an Oxford
college or of the Basque church of Urrugne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Coast.</div>

<p>Or you may attack Cintra by way of Cascaes and Collares,
since the accepted approach is rarely the best way of seeing
a place for the first time. There is a road for
part of the way from Cascaes along the coast
with sand-dunes, and hollows of scented
cistus and many a delightful cove or broader sandy bays,
which are now without a house, but might at the whim of
fashion—<i>absit omen</i>—become favourite and crowded watering-places.
Some miles from Cascaes the Mountains of the Moon
descend into the sea, ending in the famous <i>Cabo da Roca</i>,
the “Rock of Lisbon.” A little further on lies Collares in
its celebrated vineyards, and taking the road from here to
Cintra one has a view of the <i>Serra</i> above Cintra in a rugged,
almost Alpine, grandeur of grey rocks and trees, and may
understand how Fielding could call it a high mountain. To
the right the last slopes are covered with groves of arbutus
trees, which hang their berries in clustered lanterns of glowing
yellow and orange, white and green and red. Thick layers
of mist hide them on an autumn morning, through which the
sun lights up the ravines in weird spears and shafts of light.
To the left extends that fertile plain which produces nearly
all the fruits of the earth and has for centuries provided Lisbon’s
markets with their most treasured wares. Even in
summer when all the surrounding country is in a cloudless
blue the whole <i>Serra</i> of Cintra from crown to base is often
blotted out in thick white mist which folds over peak and
ravine, taking the shape of each in a more rounded softness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of snowfields. Then when a slight wind drives it off in a
bank along the horizon seaward the <i>Serra</i> appears a metallic
blue, as if it had been poured molten into the mould and was
just hardening to its definite shape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Infinite Variety.</div>

<p>The variety of Cintra is but a sample of that rich profusion
of natural beauties in the most diverse kinds throughout the
country. With an area little over a quarter
of that of Great Britain and about three times
that of Belgium, Portugal presents perhaps
greater variety of scenery and products than any other country
of Europe. Rich in trees and fruits (especially figs and
oranges), rice (it was one of the projects of the last Ministry
of the Monarchy to encourage rice-growing in Portugal), wine,
oil, maize, wheat, rye, cork, salt from the <i>marinhas</i> of
Aveiro and Algarve, honey from Alemtejo, Portugal could
also, but for State prohibitions, produce tobacco, cotton, and
the sugar-cane. The gardens on the banks of the Tagus,
the orchards of Setubal and Santarem, the fruit-gardens round
Caldas da Rainha and Alcobaça, the wide corn-lands on the
alluvial <i>lezirias</i> of the rivers Tagus and Sado, the sub-tropical
vegetation of the southern slope of the <i>Serra de Arrabida</i> and
of Cintra and of the neighbourhood of Faro and Villa Real
de S. Antonio in Algarve, prove that potentially at least
Portugal is indeed the “garden of Europe planted by the sea.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rivers.</div>

<p>The salmon in the transparent rivers of Minho are less
plentiful than they were, owing to the poaching and wholesale
destruction dating from 1498, when King
Manoel deprived the nobility of hunting and
fishing privileges in their <i>coutadas</i>. The Vez,
a tributary of the Lima, is said to be still a good trout-stream,
and some trout are to be caught in the Leça. In the Cavado,
Mondego and Zezere trout are now rare. Salmon are caught
only or chiefly in the river Minho. But the sea along Portugal’s
coasts provides her with an unfailing abundance of fish,
and the fish-markets of Lisbon and Faro are renowned for
their richness and variety all the year round. To the south,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
especially, sardines are plentiful in winter as well as in summer.
The Portuguese coast is in great part rocky and dangerous,
but these bare inhospitable cliffs are broken by little sand
coves and bays, and varied with immense bare or pine-covered
sand-dunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Climate.</div>

<p>The climate varies considerably. In the south (Algarve)
and especially in Eastern Alemtejo (where the summer
temperature can rise to 120 Fahrenheit) and
Traz os Montes (where the climate is indeed
rather Spanish than Portuguese) the heat
can be insufferable, and the winter cold of the north-east is
severe. But in the centre, and especially along the coast of
Estremadura, the climate may be described without exaggeration
as the best in Europe. The warm winters lead one to
expect tropical summers, but this expectation is not fulfilled,
and the sea and the north summer wind here moderate the
heat which can be so oppressive in the interior. The following
statistics from an article by Snr. Antonio Arroyo, in <i>Notas
sobre Portugal</i>, give the average temperatures during the
years 1856-1900 at (1) Lisbon, (2) Biarritz, (3) Nice—</p>

<p>Thus, while the Lisbon winters are nearly three degrees warmer,
the summers are barely one degree warmer. The figures are
Centigrade. To convert into Fahrenheit divide by five,
multiply by 9, and add 32. A scientific book has recently
been published on the climate round Lisbon: <i>The Climate of
Lisbon and of the two health resorts in its immediate neighbourhood,
Mont’ Estoril, on the Riviera of Portugal, and Cintra</i>.
By Dr. A. G. Delgado. Lisbon, 1914.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Estoril.</div>

<p>At Estoril a thermal station, with casino, gardens, golf-links,
etc., is in process of construction. The Estoril climate
even excels that of Lisbon, being slightly warmer in winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and cooler in summer. It is a little surprising that more
foreigners do not settle temporarily or permanently in this
region, which is so easy of access and has so
many advantages. The considerable number of
Englishmen now living in Portugal are with few
exceptions engaged in business. Possibly foreigners are afraid
of revolutions, but revolutions in Portugal do not as a rule
affect the foreigner in the slightest degree. Gambling, on a
large scale, and great luxury, it is true, he will not find, but
cleanliness and ordinary comfort are to be had at the existing
hôtels, and any other deficiencies are amply compensated for
by the excellent climate and the charms and interest of the
surrounding country, and by the courtesy and helpfulness of
its inhabitants. It is not often that travellers can live in a
comfortable hôtel, have English newspapers, English books
(from the Lisbon International Library), English tinned foods
and tobacco, all the delights and none of the drawbacks of
a southern climate, and at the same time such scenery to their
hand as that of Cintra, and such architecture as is to be had
on all sides in a day’s motor drive, besides lawn-tennis and
golf, and the historical associations of the Peninsular War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Backwardness of the Country.</div>

<p>Rarely does the country appear to be fully developed, yet
even so it produces such a wealth of fruits and flowers that
evidently with greater care, better methods,
and a more widely extended system of irrigation,
it might be a perfect paradise. It would
be unfair to attribute the neglect and backwardness
and misery prevailing throughout this lovely country
entirely to the character of the inhabitants. The accumulated
misfortunes of their history for the last three centuries would
be enough to explain it; but they certainly have been inclined
to neglect their own native soil for alien enterprises, and are
only now beginning to realise that the future of Portugal lies
in Portugal. In time, no doubt, Algarve, Estremadura, and
Minho will be fringed with prosperous watering-places and
with busy seaports, to which railways from the interior will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
carry many minerals, wood from existing forests and from
land still awaiting afforestation, as well as the most varied
vegetables, fruits and flowers. (Foreign countries will find
it profitable also to import on a large scale earthenware
manufactures, <i>azulejos</i>, and the majolica wares of Caldas da
Rainha.) Irrigation will have transformed much <i>matto</i>
country into flourishing gardens and orchards, and Alemtejo
will become in fact as well as in name the granary of Portugal.
It is quite possible for Portugal to become one continuous
garden city, through which flawless roads will whirl the traveller
in a few hours from Valença to Faro, and from Elvas to Cintra.
This is the object at which those who care more for Portugal
than for party politics must aim.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Travelling in Portugal.</div>

<p>But the charm will have departed, and present-day travellers
may congratulate themselves that the change is not in their
day. For now parts of the country are not
to be seen without considerable effort, and
have the added fascination of things difficult
of attainment. The Portuguese rarely journey for enjoyment
south of the Tagus, to the land <i>alemtejo</i>, yet both the Alemtejo
and Algarve are delightful districts, and fully repay any
little discomforts which a visit to them may entail, and the
impression left is of a great region of wild flowers and garden
fruits lying in a semi-tropical sunshine, round a few villages
and ancient towns. Indeed, those who have seen not only
Minho and the massed rhododendrons in flower on the <i>Serra
do Gerez</i>, and the smooth mountains of the <i>Serra da Estrella</i>,
apparently bare and desolate, covered with cistus, lavender,
and a thousand other varieties of wild flowers, but also the
rare flowers and rhododendrons of the <i>Serra de Monchique</i> in
Algarve, and the giant patchwork of all kinds and colours of
flowers which make beautiful the pastures and wastelands of
Alemtejo, from the tall branching asphodels, like chandeliers
of chalcedony, to the serried fields of thistle or hawksweed,
will readily extend to the whole of Portugal the name of
“Switzerland of Spain,” which has been bestowed on Galicia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
(The word “Spain,” meaning the whole Peninsula, once
common, is still in use occasionally, as in the title of the
Archbishop of Braga, who is “Primate of the Spains.”)
The roads of Portugal are a delight by reason of their wayside
springs and streams and groves, and the hedges which in
height and thickness rival those of Devonshire, and have all
the luxuriant growth of the south. Or, when the road cuts
through <i>matto</i>, thick masses of cistus often invade it on either
side, and the air is heavy with its scent. (Both in leaf and
scent it strongly resembles escalonia.) A walking tour is more
often a hardship than a pleasure, or rather its pleasure is of
recollections, especially where, as in Spain, inns are rare and
food in an inn rarer. But Portugal, that is in the northern
provinces—for the sun tyrannises south of the Tagus and
shade is rarer—is an ideal country for such a tour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inns.</div>

<p>The witty Nicolaus Clenardus, in the sixteenth century,
after complaining that at an inn in Spain his horses had well
fasted, and he himself had had but half an
ounce of meat in an <i>olla</i>, and departed as he
came, <i>latrante stomacho</i>, admitted that in
Portugal things were better: <i>omnia mitescere visa sunt</i>. It is
true that the author of the <i>Arte de Furtar</i>, writing a few
generations later, gives us a melancholy initiation into the
ways of the inn-hostess of Beja. “I saw her,” he says, “buy
two cabbages for a halfpenny. She cast them into a caldron
with two large <i>pimentos</i> well crushed and another halfpenny-worth
of oil. She boiled them twice, and without ever
rising from her stool, she made thirty plates full at a penny
each, with which she feasted guests and carters alike, and they
professed themselves satisfied.” There is something sinister
about this stationary woman. <i>Sedet aeternumque sedebit.</i>
Probably if an old shoe had been to hand, instead of the
<i>pimentões</i>, in it would have gone. But, however far afield the
twentieth century traveller wanders, Heaven will probably
keep him from such a hostess in Portugal—in Spain she is
still common—and everywhere he will find great willingness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
to attend to his requirements, such readiness in fact that
he will probably expect to be asked for several shillings
and be surprised to be charged only in <i>vintens</i>. Of course,
in a sense the more poorly he goes clad the better he will fare
in the out-of-the-way parts, the poor reserving a wealth of
kindliness and ready service exclusively for the poor. The
<i>hospedarias</i> are bare and clean, the <i>estalagens</i> are not much less
comfortable than the <i>hospedarias</i>, and sometimes as clean.
The <i>estalagem</i> is where any passing wayfarer—carriers,
<i>almocreves</i>, etc., put up; the <i>hospedarias</i> are rather for more
permanent guests, officers quartered in the town, and so on.
But even the wayside <i>venda</i>, perhaps consisting of a single
room, roofed over with branches and with the trodden ground
for floor, will be able to provide a meal of eggs, coffee, and
bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walking in Portugal.</div>

<p>The water difficulty is not present as in Spain. Springs and
rivulets of most excellent transparent water, flowing cleanly
over granite, are ever to the hand of the
thirsty, icy cold even in the dog days, and the
great flowered hedges will yield him a plot of
shade for a rest even if he does not hit on some pleasant
grove of trees and flowers. It is to be hoped that the <i>Sociedade
de Propaganda de Portugal</i>, which watches over the interests
of the more respectable tourist, will not forget to attend to
the needs of the humble pedestrian, and indeed of the motorist,
by seeing to it that sign-posts and milestones be set on all the
roads. These can be of such a character as not in the least
to obtrude upon the rustic character of these delightful roads.
In Portugal the pedestrian has the great advantage over the
motorist that he is able to digest what he sees, and even he
will have to advance in very leisurely fashion in order to do
that. It is the charm of Alcobaça and Batalha—those two
marvellous buildings—that they have no railway. You may
drive or walk, but even if you walk it is but a few miles from
the one to the other, through a tempting country of dense
pinewoods and heather, with the village of Aljubarrota and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the famous battlefield thrown in. To see in one day the
multifarious splendours of Batalha and Alcobaça, not to
speak of Leiria, is more than is good for the ordinary person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leiria.</div>

<p>Leiria is little more than a village, a delightful village set
in trees and flowers, orchards and vineyards, with the sound
of the rushing river Lis ever present. On
a sheer hill above it stands crumbling in
flowers the ruins of King Diniz’ Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luso and Bussaco.</div>

<p>The village of Luso, too, beneath Bussaco, is embedded in
flowers and creepers, and Bussaco itself, of course, consists
of nothing but the remnants of a convent and
a single modern hôtel, all the rest being a vast
enclosure of trees, creepers, brushwood,
shrubs and ferns and flowers probably unequalled in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Villages.</div>

<p>And countless villages throughout Portugal are literally
set in and scented with flowers. A writer of the seventeenth
century describes one of them thus: “Each
house has its garden with various trees,
oranges, and lemons, which fill the whole
town with the sweetest scent and with their gay flowers.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
For fuel all kinds of scented brushwood are burnt—cistus,
rosemary, myrtle—the thin blue smoke of which is a sweet
incense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cascaes and the Estoris.</div>

<p>Even on the rocky coast, at Cascaes near Lisbon, many
flowers are to be found. Where there is any moisture periwinkles
star the ground, and in the strip
immediately along the coast burnt by the
winter spray, flower dwarf irises in crowds.
They know that the sea-winds blow chiefly in winter, and
cunningly wait till they have little to fear from the spray,
springing into flower at the end of April or beginning of May.
It is, however, the land wind (the <i>nortadas</i> that begin slightly
in spring and prevail in July and August) which blackens
and bruises creepers and flowers. This wind has something
of the subtle winds of Spain, whence it comes, and is disliked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
by some persons, but by those who shun intense heat it is
welcomed in the summer months. It brings cloudless skies
without great heat. It transforms all things to a clearer
outline and darkens the sea to a deep sapphire, flecked with
white horses. Under the cliffs the water in such weather—which
may continue for ten days or a fortnight—is calm
and transparent, and the sunshine ripples and plays in wrinkles
of amber on the deep-sunken rocks, transmuted for the time
into great slabs of beryl, jasper and emerald. In summer
a whole population lives for weeks together fishing in these
waters. Almost everything that will float is put into requisition,
and the queerest craft make their appearance, long
crescent-shaped boats that seem scarcely to touch the water,
old boats with a single square black or tawny sail, boats with
sails cherry-red, white, and brown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth of Flowers.</div>

<p>At Estoril, which almost joins Cascaes, live many of the
foreigners settled in Lisbon, and here the houses, mostly well
sheltered by a pine-covered hill, have gardens
brimming with flowers, winter and summer.
Still more sheltered is Cintra, on the other
side of the <i>Serra</i>, where the work of the gardener consists
rather in cutting away than in encouraging growth. The
road from Cintra to Collares is hemmed by wonderful gardens
and orchards, although there is still plenty of ground
waiting to be enclosed and turned into a little Monserrate.
Some of these orchards are half neglected, and one may wander
gradually from woodland into weedy garden paths where
orange trees, crowded with glowing fruit, grow apparently
at random. (And the oranges of Cintra vie with those of
Setubal, at the mouth of the Sado.) It is from Collares in
great part that Lisbon fills its markets daily with an abundance
of fruits and flowers. “He who goes to the Church of the
Misericordia will find daily from fifteen to twenty girls selling
flowers, loose or in wreaths and bunches.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The author, Frey
Nicolas d’Oliveyra, adds that on the 4th of August, 1620, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
one <i>fête</i> in four Lisbon churches three thousand wreaths and
two thousand bunches of flowers were used. If less flowers
now adorn Lisbon’s churches their number has not diminished,
and exportation of flowers and fruits on a vast scale only
awaits quicker means of transport and intelligent markets in
foreign countries. For the flowers fill the great uncultivated
tracts of the country with scent and colour, and wherever some
minor Beckford has enclosed a plot of ground he is rewarded
by a true garden of Eden.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONVENTS AND PALACES</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Belem.</div>

<p>In palaces and convents, churches, castles, towers, crumbling
Roman ruins, fine country houses, Portugal is as rich as any
land. The chief attraction of the Palacio das
Necessidades at Lisbon is its splendid grounds,
now open to the public. From the Tagus
the most imposing building is the great mass of the Church of
S. Vicente, which the morbid visit to see the Princes and
Kings of Portugal in their glass-covered coffins. Of Lisbon’s
ancient buildings that which most forcibly appeals to eye and
imagination is the ruined Carmo, now serving as an archaeological
museum, standing so nobly over the city and carrying
the mind back to the days of Nun’ Alvares Pereira, one of the
greatest figures of all time. But the finest building of Lisbon—since
a street now connects with the capital what was formerly
a separate village, is the Church and Convent of Belem.
The village still, however, maintains a certain individuality,
with its wide common surrounded by low pink-washed houses
and primitive arcades, and its statue of Affonso d’Albuquerque
perched, like St. Simeon Stylites, on a high pillar, and looking
out across the Tagus to the Atlantic, its peculiar square
Tower of Belem jutting out into the river and, above all, the
church of the Convent, which in its perfect proportions and
ancient grey colouring is one of the most beautiful of the
world’s buildings. To realise its beauty, the church must
not be seen too near, since the famous doorway will seem to
many excessively ornamented in its wealth of detail. But
from the river seen in spring above the flowering Judas trees,
or above the yellowing leaves in autumn, it might be some
old Oxford college. And the interior is worthy of such beauty,
in spite of the Manoeline style, which does its best to spoil
the noble Gothic, in relation to which it stands as ivy to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
trunk of a tree. The pillars go straight up without a break
to a height of nearly a hundred feet, and about the whole
place is a sense of spaciousness and fine proportion which the
Manoeline decoration cannot mar. In little chapels round the
church are the tombs of King Manoel I (who built the Convent
to celebrate the voyage of Vasco da Gama, the buildings thus
corresponding in stone to the Lusiads of Camões: <i>ceci n’a
pas tué cela</i>); of his son King João III, variously judged by
historians as a saint or a simpleton (it is not for nothing that
the Spanish word for “blessed,” <i>bendito</i>, means also a fool:
<i>cf.</i> the English “silly,” derived from the German <i>selig</i>); of
Camões and of Vasco da Gama (the tomb is his, but there was
a mistake in the bones when they were transferred thither
from Vidigueira in 1880).</p>

<p>From Lisbon to Cintra is but a step, and it is equally
pleasant to walk or drive or ride, but the train will take you
there in little over half-an-hour. What
strikes everyone on arriving at the village is
the curious prominence of the two uncouth
gigantic chimneys of the palace. This palace is now an
archaeological museum, but the interest still centres in the
legends and history and natural beauty of its walls, for the
most part lined with fine old <i>azulejos</i>. The magpies of the
ceiling in the Sala das Pegas have not been whitewashed away,
the Sala dos Cisnes still keeps its swans, and the coats of arms
cover the walls of the Sala dos Cervos, a stag in each case
supporting the arms of the old families of Portugal—</p>

<p class="noindent">A path or no path leads to the grey ruined walls of the Castello
dos Mouros above the village. Here legend would have it
that the hapless poet, Bernardim Ribeiro, came to sigh for
his royal mistress, King Manoel I’s daughter, who, however,
probably left Lisbon and Cintra for Savoy some weeks before
Ribeiro came to Lisbon from Alemtejo.</p>

</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Castello da Pena.</div>

<p>Far above on its peak, conspicuous far out to sea on both
sides of the Serra, but in shape so different, as seen from
Mafra or Collares and from the Estoril side,
that one scarcely realises that it is the same
building, stands the Castello da Pena, over
1,700 feet above sea-level. Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg,
husband of Queen Maria II of Portugal, bought the
place towards the middle of the nineteenth century for a few
hundred pounds. It was then merely a ruin of the convent
built there by King Manoel I. The surrounding woods and
gardens and the magnificent views from every window make
this palace one of the most wonderful houses in Europe,
wonderful, too, in the wealth of designs on pillar and archway
(in imitation of the style Manoeline), and in many incidental
beauties, especially the altar of alabaster and grey marble
in the chapel. Below, set in luxuriant growth of azaleas and
camellias, are the flower-gardens and the Fonte dos Passarinhos
or das Andorinhas, with its white marble swallows drinking.
In the palace private photographs and weapons belonging to
the Portuguese Royal Family still hang from the walls, and
the tables are covered with magazines and newspapers, dated
October, 1910, precisely as on that autumn day on which
Queen Amélie heard here the faint booming of the guns
from Lisbon in revolution. Those who are not content with
the exquisite partial view from the terrace of the dining-room
climb by a little outer staircase to the wind-swept cupola.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Winter and summer every wind that blows seems to redouble
its force just here. For the sake of the view a north-east
wind is to be preferred, but the view is always magnificent
and extensive, in spite of the fact that it is bounded on two
sides by the Atlantic. White sands mark the entrance of the
Tagus with the Serra d’Ossa and Alemtejo beyond, and the
long headland which begins in beautiful sand-dunes—beautiful
in certain lights and days—and runs out to Cape Espichel.
On afternoons of a clear land wind the cape is lit up by the
sun in every crevice of its sheer white cliffs and stands out
like an island in mid-ocean—with a strong resemblance to the
southern cliffs of England. Immediately beneath the palace
walls are the famous woods of the grounds down the sides of
the Serra. The Serra itself extends on one side to the small
villages of Charneca (Moor) and Areias (Sands), and on the
other to Collares and the Praia das Maçãs (Shore of Apples).
All this country is really a promontory some twenty miles
across, between the Atlantic and the vast estuary of the Tagus.
To the east the view includes such fragments of Lisbon as
are not concealed by hills, while on the north a great black
patch in the level plain is the Convent of Mafra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mafra.</div>

<p>The Convent of Mafra is eighteenth century, and would
be uninteresting were it not for its sheer hugeness, which
seems to defy you to criticise. It bullies you
into accepting its ugliness, and stuns you with
figures. Thus, you have scarcely recovered
from the gigantic proportions of its towers and the steps
hundreds of feet long in front of them when you are told
that it was nearly thirty years a-building, and employed at
times nearly 50,000 builders, that the tale of its doors is
5,200, of its windows 2,500. If you are incredulous, count
them. The whole building measures some 275 by 240 yards,
nearly a sixth of a mile long. The church is a glory of pink
and white marble, magnificent but not beautiful. Yet it is
worth going through Mafra to see the front of Mafra’s Convent,
even if one does not stop to enter the building. The railway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
station is ten kilomètres from the village, so that most people
drive there, but if anyone likes to take train to Mafra’s station,
walk thence to Mafra, and then straight across to Cintra, he
will be rewarded by a splendid view of the Serra to shorten his
way. Seen from here, it is a gigantic wing folded over the
village of Cintra, grey crags and dark wooded ravines, with
the Cruz Alta, the Castle of Pena, and the Castle of the Moors
to mark the heights. Mafra is about thirty-five <i>kilomètres</i>
north-west of Lisbon, and another hundred <i>kilomètres</i>
intervene between Mafra and Vallado—no unpleasant three
days’ walk. Vallado is at about equal distance from Nazareth
and the sea on one side and Alcobaça on the other.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CLOISTER OF D. DINIZ, ALCOBAÇA.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Alcobaça.</div>

<p>To whatever pains the traveller may be put before reaching
Alcobaça he will think nothing thereof when he sees the
interior of this old Cistercian abbey, and to
many the very remoteness of Alcobaça and
Batalha, lying fortunately miles from any
railway station, is no mean attraction. This Convent, like
that of Mafra, is now used partly as barracks and partly as
prison—the mixed company of prisoners may be seen white
and hungry, stretching out their hands through the bars to
the village street. But, whereas Mafra as a barracks seems
to be usefully fulfilling its proper purpose, to quarter a regiment
in Alcobaça’s monastery savours of desecration. However, the
principal cloisters, the Cloisters of Dom Diniz, are still and
peaceful, surrounding with their beautiful arches plots gay
with flowers, as when the monks sought or sheltered from the
sun here and were buried beneath the flagstones. Here is
an old well with its ferns and crumbling Gothic architecture,
and the whole place may give many an intense desire to have
the good monks back there to enjoy it instead of half-a-dozen
flurried and unappreciative tourists. The climate of Portugal
makes it an ideal country for all whose sole vocation is endless
contemplation, and where better fulfil that vocation than in
these lovely convents! In winter the building provides a
hundred corners of hot sun, and in hot weather the cold stone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and the sound of running water recall some Seville <i>patio</i>.
The guide-books for every two or three pages given to Batalha,
will devote but one to Alcobaça. Yet for those who care for
pure Gothic the latter is perhaps even the more attractive of
the two. The narrow aisles, plain majestic pillars, and nobly
sculptured capitals, make of its early Gothic church a severe
and lovely building, and historically, of course, the interest
of the place is very great. In the Sala dos Reis are statues of
the early kings of Portugal, and <i>azulejo</i> scenes of the events
which led to the foundation of the convent. As is well known,
it was Affonso Henriques (that is, son of Count Henry of
Burgundy), who began it, owing to an oath he had made to
build a convent in the event of taking Santarem from the
Moors. The capture of Santarem (1147 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) was but one of
the many successes of that great warrior king, the first king
and the real founder of Portugal as a separate nation. Compared
with so early a date, the giant caldron taken from
the Spaniards after the battle of Aljubarrota (1385) is almost
modern. It also stands in the Sala dos Reis, and it is well
that one memorial of the deeds of the great Constable should
be here, for the hero of Aljubarrota, Nun’ Alvares, and Affonso
I had much in common. Both won many victories, and
founded churches and convents, and both were inspired by a
passionate love of the independence of their country. If
Nun’ Alvares was the more chivalrous of the two this must be
attributed to the intervening centuries. But it is not of
Affonso Henriques that most visitors think when they are at
Alcobaça, but of a time one generation earlier than that of
Nun’ Alvares, who was but seven when King Pedro I (1357-67)
died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inés de Castro.</div>

<p>In one of the chapels of Alcobaça’s church are the tombs
of King Pedro and of Inés de Castro. Legend would have
it that they were buried feet to feet, in order
that when the trumpet of the Day of Judgment
sounded their eyes might meet at once
as they rose from the dead. In the striking lines of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Portuguese poet, Snr. Affonso Lopes Vieira—striking by
reason of their fine sound and volume—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">As their eyes meet at length in fond embrace.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such subtleties were scarcely of that age, but the tombs (and
their recumbent figures) certainly face one another, minutely
and delightfully carved in stone. The rivers Alcoa and Baça
meet at Alcobaça, and a tributary of the Alcoa, a tiny stream,
runs beneath the convent. Some of the tombs in this Capella
dos Tumulos are green with damp and run a fair chance of
permanent injury. King Diniz’ mother as well as the children
of Pedro and Inés are buried in the same chapel. Round the
cruel fate of lovely Inés a whole literature has grown up in
prose and verse, from the fine verses of the courtier poet
Garcia de Resende—far the best that he wrote—in the reign
of King Manoel I to the poem <i>Costança</i> by Snr. Eugenio de
Castro, and the sonnet which the two lines quoted above
close. There is scarcely an educated Portuguese who does
not try his hand at poetry, and scarcely a Portuguese poet
who escapes the temptation to renew in verse the tragic tale
of Inés de Castro. The temptation is the greater in that
she lived and died a stone’s throw from the halls of Coimbra,
in which most Portuguese receive their education, and represents
in her romantic story and sorrowful ending all that is
most <i>meigo</i> and <i>saudoso</i> in Portuguese <i>saudade</i>. From the
fifteenth to the twentieth century the Inés legend runs like
a connecting link through Portuguese literature, and if it
has never yet been treated with more than a pretty lyric
wistfulness in minor poems beautiful but subjective, perhaps
these are the basis and preparation for the great poet who will
record it in a spirit of true and high Tragedy worthy of the
subject and of these Alcobaça sculptures. Pedro and Inés
do not even meet in the celebrated drama, <i>Inés de Castro</i>, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Antonio Ferreira (1528-69). He discreetly left that for
the Day of Judgment, rightly feeling, no doubt, that his own
powers of description and psychology would be inadequate
to the occasion. So they still lie waiting separated by these
barriers of incomparable sculpture in the gloomy damp
Chapel of the Tombs. With relief the visitor emerges to the
sunny cloisters, a part of which really dates from the days
of stout-hearted King Diniz and escaped the far-spread
destruction of the Peninsular War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Batalha.</div>

<p>Portugal’s Battle Abbey, the Mosteiro da Batalha or de
Santa Maria da Vitoria commemorates a victory not over the
Moors, but over the invading Spaniard in the
battle of Aljubarrota, King João I against
King Juan I. The military genius and
enthusiasm of Nun’ Alvares won the day. King João two
years later married an English wife. Their children were
given an English education, and became Prince Henry the
Navigator, King Edward the Eloquent, one of the masters
of early Portuguese prose, the Infante Pedro, also author and
statesman, and the Infante Fernando, who died loyally in
Africa, a happier death than that which awaited his brother
Pedro, killed in a civil feud in the reign of his nephew Affonso
V. English was all the order of the day, the story of King
Arthur penetrated deep into Portuguese Court life and literature,
the knightly Galahad was Nun’ Alvares’ model and hero.
And under English influence, perhaps English workmen, was
begun the great monastery which stands so nobly apart, grey
traceries and pinnacles in a hollow of dark pine-covered hills.
It must ever continue to be one of the chief attractions to
those who visit Portugal, and it is to be hoped that it will
ever retain its rustic situation, far from trains, hôtels and
all those appurtenances of civilisation which usually dog the
tourist’s footsteps. Indeed, this sequestered region between
Leiria and Alcobaça will to many, whether they drive or walk,
but especially if they walk, remain the principal among their
many delightful memories of Portugal. The church of Batalha<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
is more magnificent than that of Alcobaça, yet in some respects
as severely beautiful. These lordly pillars have none of the
false ornament which defaces the pillars of Belem, and the
arches are of unrivalled boldness and beauty of proportion.
Some of the windows have kept pieces of fine old stained glass
among much modern stuff. In the Chapel of the Founders
are the tombs of the Master of Aviz, João I, of his wife Philippa
of Lancaster, and of their sons, Pedro, Enrique, João, and
Fernando (the Infante Santo), whose untimely fate probably
hastened the death of his brother, King Duarte, whose tomb
is in another chapel of this church. The king was equally
unwilling to give up Ceuta, for the surrender of which Prince
Fernando had remained hostage, or to be responsible for his
brother’s death. It was only two years after King Duarte’s
death at Thomar in 1438 that the Infante’s sufferings in a
Moorish dungeon ended. They were borne with a patience
and intrepidity which made of him a true <i>principe constante</i>.
His story is told in the <i>Cronica do Infante Santo D. Fernando</i>,
by Frei João Alvarez. It is poetic justice that this splendid
building should unite in death these five brothers who were
as talented and as mutually affectionate as they were ill-fated—if
fortunate implies long life rather than fine character or
high deeds accomplished. Alcobaça for the most part scorns
the Manoeline style and the church of Batalha is as purely
Gothic. Its cloisters, however, and Unfinished Chapels
(Capellas Imperfeitas) are the very flower of Manoeline.
This strange style, typical of Portuguese restlessness and
longing for new things, was introduced in the age of Portugal’s
great discoveries and partly under Oriental influence. However
inartistic its general effect, in details it is often beautiful,
and always interesting as commemorating Portugal’s naval
glories and the new animals, plants, shells, etc., found beyond
the seas. The many minute designs, as well as the cryptic
“Greek” inscriptions (really French: <i>Tant que seray lealte
faray</i>) of these arches in the Unfinished Chapels are full of
interest. The first view of Batalha gives an impression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
greyness; but, nearer, the lower part is found to be built
of stone originally snow-white, which changes to the most
varied hues of yellow and grey as time and weather mould
and stain it. With keen regret must travellers leave Batalha
to take their way along the white road between pines to
Alcobaça or Leiria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomar.</div>

<p>A longer tramp or drive going East from Leiria takes one
to Thomar in the very heart of Portugal, unless one goes by
train to Payalvo, a few <i>kilomètres</i> from
Thomar on the other side. The town and
its river may have exchanged names since
the ancient Nabantia apparently had a river called Thomar,
whereas the river’s name is now Nabão. The site of Nabantia
is supposed to be occupied now by the Church of Santa Maria
do Olival, the oldest church of the Templars in Portugal, built
by Gualdim Paes, one of the heroes of legendary feats of arms
in the reign of the first King of Portugal. If in parts of the
interior of Batalha the Manoeline style is seen in all its glory,
in the Convent of Thomar it is the outside walls that display
it in a way so bold and magnificent as to silence the carpers.
It may be said that it is magnificent, but that it is not art:
yet it was well that in at least one great building the outer
walls should bear silent witness through the centuries to
Portugal’s great achievement. Chain and grummet and rope,
coral from distant seas, flowers and plants and birds from
tropical lands, anchors and even—a conception as strange as
its execution was happy—great bellying sails in stone,
represent the story of those ships (ships of a few score
tons)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Que foram descobrir mundos e mares.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Convent contains a succession of cloisters and architecture
of many centuries, the original Church of the Templars
being of the twelfth century, when Affonso I relied on their
strong right arms to force back the Moors mile by mile to the
south. Indeed, the building is a perfect wilderness of courts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and corridors. Gualdim Paes is not the only hero of these
now deserted halls, for Prince Henry the Navigator was
Grand Master of Thomar for over forty years, till his death in
1460, and devoted the greater part of the revenues of the
Templars to further the cause he had most at heart—the
extension of Christianity into lands and seas unknown. The
view from the terrace is of surpassing beauty, and it seems a
pity that there is no one living here permanently to enjoy it.
The gently sloping hills are covered with every variety of
green, from the grey of olives to the dark leaves of orange-trees.
On the other side there is a view of Thomar beneath
the Convent, a most curious town, of bare discomfortable
look by reason of its angular buildings, steep towers and spires,
severe mediaeval churches and clean streets of cobbles without
side pavement. Its paper mills flourish, so that it does not
stand aloof from modern industry and progress, but its
inhabitants maintain an old-fashioned pride in themselves
and their town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coimbra.</div>

<p>Coimbra lies some sixty miles due north of Thomar, on the
other side of the <i>Serra de Louzã</i>, westernmost offshoot of the
<i>Serra da Estrella</i>. Its look is far less grey
and stern than that of Thomar. Most of its
buildings are whitewashed, and a few washed
in pink or yellow, so that the old cathedral stands out like
a great mass of rock from among the tier after tier of houses
that cover the steep hill above the Mondego. Indeed, it is
the exterior of the Sé Velha that is chiefly remarkable, in its
massive and imposing grandeur. Coimbra has many other
fine old buildings set among its serried houses. The University
or Schools (<i>Paços das Escholas</i>) stands at the very top of
the town, its clock-tower pointing skyward. Students in their
long black coats, white ties, and flowing gowns (<i>capas</i>),
bareheaded even in July, when the summer term ends, are
to be seen everywhere in the narrow streets or along the
river and famous walk under the poplars (the <i>Choupal</i>). The
Faculty of Theology is now abolished, but they may study<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
mathematics, philosophy, philology, medicine, and especially
they study law as a preliminary to a political career. They
enter the University younger than is usual at an English
University and remain longer—about eight years. The
University with its spacious quadrangles, fine halls, and
library, is surrounded by a view of valleys, hills and river
such as surely no other University in the world can boast.
The Mondego is one of the most beautiful rivers of Northern
Portugal, the land of transparent rivers and streams flowing
over granite and tinged by no taint of soil. Close to the
Mondego across the bridge is the remnant of the old convent
of Santa Clara. It is now a farmhouse and the fine capitals
of its pillars between which the oxen have their stalls are now
but a few feet from the ground, so great is the volume of sand
carried down by the <i>cheias</i> of the river. It flows so <i>mansamente</i>,
clear and gentle, but owing to the rockiness of its bed
has no elasticity, and a few hours of heavy rain suffice to turn
it into a huge rushing torrent. The new Mosteiro de Santa
Clara is built high above the level of the river, and the Quinta
das Lagrimas stands some way from its banks. Here the
Fonte dos Amores flows from a rock of ferns and flowers through
a rough cross-shaped channel of stone, the iron-red stains of
which are supposed to mark the place where Inés de Castro
was murdered in 1355, a date hardly less celebrated in Portugal
than that other fifty-five of the great Lisbon earthquake four
centuries later. All these buildings are on the left bank of the
river among a lovely orchard-country of orange, cherry, and
pomegranate. The principal building in Coimbra itself after
the Sé Velha is the Mosteiro de Santa Cruz, which was built
in the twelfth century, and contains the tombs of Affonso and
Sancho, the first two Kings of Portugal. Its church is much
later, built by Marcos Pires in the sixteenth century. He
was also the architect of the Convent’s Manoeline “Cloisters
of Silence.” But Coimbra as a whole seen from the green
Mondego or from the Mosteiro de Santa Clara beyond it, is a
work of art, and both the town and surrounding country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
deserve a far more prolonged study than they usually
receive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Striking Positions.</div>

<p>It is in the strip of country between Tagus and Mondego
that Portugal has massed her most famous and beautiful
buildings, and the hurried traveller can thus
within a space of about a hundred miles see
Belem and Cintra and Mafra, Alcobaça,
Batalha, and Thomar, Santarem, Leiria and Coimbra. But
Portugal possesses a hundred other towns and towers so
splendidly situated as to need little art for their beauty’s
heightening. What can be finer, for instances at random,
than the position of Palmella or of Covilhã, or high-perched
Guarda, or Louzã, or the castle of Melgaço, or the ruins of
the monastery of Crato, the early home of Nun’ Alvares, or
of the castle of Almourol on its Tagus islet, the site chosen by
the Romans and the castle famous in the adventures of
Palmeirim of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minho.</div>

<p>The provinces of Minho and Traz os Montes, which limit
Portugal to the north, have few great buildings. Minho is
celebrated rather for its woods and hills and
streams, its cheerful <i>quintas</i> in pleasant
surroundings of maize and granite, than for
its ancient buildings. It is not a country of large towns.
Several unpretentious small towns it has along its sand and
pine coast, Villa do Conde. Povoa de Varzim and Vianna
do Castello, the latter beautiful in its sheltered position at
the mouth of the river Lima. It is worth following up this
river, which inspired the poet Diogo Bernardes with his
tenderest verses, and to which his thoughts turned longingly
when a captive in Africa after the battle of Alcacer Kebir,
for it really is beautiful, and the <i>quintas</i> and villages most
interesting. The capital of Minho, Braga, has few old
buildings besides the Cathedral, which is said to date from
the first years of Portugal’s existence, and preserves the
tomb of Count Henry of Burgundy, father of Portugal’s first
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Traz os Montes.</div>

<p>Traz os Montes, the neighbouring province to the east,
has even fewer towns. Its villages lie like those of Castille
in a bleak and shadeless country. The only
two with pretensions to the name of town are
Villa Real, the capital, and Bragança. Both
of these towns are most curious. They have rather many
interesting scraps of carved wood and stone than any great
buildings, but the Castle of the Braganzas is one of the finest
of the many noble castles that crown the hills of Portugal.
It is surrounded by a wall within which is a little village of
streets and shops of its own, so that it forms a miniature town
above Bragança. The wall hides these low houses, tiny shops
and narrow streets from sight, and the town of Bragança itself
is in a hollow, so that from some distance one sees only the
great castle standing out among the bare treeless hills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oporto.</div>

<p>Oporto, too, has succeeded in retaining its individuality.
The towns of Portugal have to thank their position on steep
hills, strong sites chosen against attack of
Moor or Christian, for having kept in some
at least of their quarters a peculiar character
of mediaeval charm. So steep are many of Oporto’s streets
that a strike of tramcars—which in Portugal ascend streets
truly perpendicular—leaves the citizens in a comical helplessness,
infants without arms. Oporto covers several hills on the
right bank of the Douro. The river is here so narrow, the
granite banks so steep that from some points of the city one
may look across from one bank to the other without realising
that there is any break or that a river flows between. Oporto
is the only city of Portugal besides Lisbon. The latest returns
give a population of 194,000. The total number of foreigners
is 7,210, of which 3,110 are Brazilians, 2,764 Spaniards, 289
French, 229 Germans, and 579 English (census of 1911).
It is a busy industrial city, and has no parades of idleness
like Lisbon, where the busy workers are crushed away into side
streets and quays, for fear the foreigner should see such undignified
behaviour. The true <i>Lisboeta’s</i> ambition is to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
nothing, and to do it elegantly. On the other hand, the
inhabitant of Oporto is proud of his business. He is more
vigorous and active, and has a sterner and more independent
outlook on life. And the two cities are rivals, sometimes
almost bitterly hostile. It is the steep right bank of the Douro
which has provided Oporto with its most curious and conservative
quarters. There is here little scope for change. The
narrow streets descend so sheerly that they have become
in places mere flights of stone steps, and the coal smoke of
Oporto gives them a coat of blackness. It is the most
northern in look of all southern cities. If you were to transport
a part of the City or some town of the North of England
to the radiant sunshine and crushing heat of Portugal, you
might have a like effect. Not that Oporto has not plenty of
colour in detail, but the first impression is one of iron-grey and
gloom. The fine old Cathedral stands immediately above
these steep descents to the river. One says “old” naturally,
although it retains nothing of the twelfth century, when it
was founded, and much of it is quite modern: for the granite
of which it is built has a look of age even in its first youth.
The cloisters are five centuries old, the oldest part of the
building. In the sordid surroundings and in the summer heat,
which can be more oppressive at Oporto than at Lisbon, the
Cathedral is a cool refuge to which, however, few of the
citizens have apparently the leisure to go; or the energy,
unless they live in some little black court or smothered alley
in its neighbourhood. More central is the eighteenth-century
Priests’ Tower—Torre dos Clerigos—nearly a twentieth of a
mile high, from which all Oporto and the surrounding country
can be seen. Oporto has older buildings, as the Church of
São Martinho de Cedofeita, of the twelfth century, but the
real pride of its citizens is in the Jardim da Cordoaria, planted
fifty years ago, in the Palacio de Crystal, of the same date,
built in imitation of the Crystal Palace, in the statue of Prince
Henry the Navigator (1900); the “Avenue of Fountains”
above the Douro and the 200 ft. high bridge of Dom Luiz I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
across it. On top of the left bank in rocky prominence is the
old Convent of the Augustinians, Nossa Senhora da Serra do
Pilar, famous in the Peninsular War, and beneath are the
gaily washed cellars and <i>armazens</i> of the port-wine merchants
in the most ancient town of Gaia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alemtejo and Algarve.</div>

<p>Rarely does the foreign traveller in Portugal, rarely the
Portuguese traveller on pleasure bent, cross the Tagus.
Alemtejo and Algarve are relegated for the
most part to the glare of the sun and to
farmers, engineers and commercial travellers.
Only a few cunning persons know that a whole new kingdom
of pleasure and interest here awaits the enterprising. But
it must be confessed that the travelling is not easy, and that
the train which saunters along the single railway, zigzagging
towards Algarve, takes a whole day to reach Faro from Lisbon.
The foreigner coming from Badajoz sees the delightful town
of Elvas, sees perhaps Estremoz or Portalegre. But many
other towns and villages deserve his attention, Setubal for its
position and groves of oranges, Santarem for its splendid
view of the Tagus valley, Vianna do Alemtejo, a white village
above wide charnecas, Monchique, high in the southernmost
<i>serra</i> of Portugal, the ancient Silves, once a flourishing city
of the Moors, Sines and Sagres for their more modern
historical associations, Lagos in its beautiful sheltered bay
calling to all those who like hot winters, Portimão with its no
less beautiful Praia da Rocha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beja.</div>

<p>Beja, in the heart of Alemtejo, rightly has an ox in its
city arms, a strong frontier town transformed into a centre
of agriculture since the days of King Diniz.
It is seen from far across the level plain, a
beautiful old town on a hill, its outline of
crumbling walls and towers clear against the sky. Its castle,
with the magnificent Torre de Menagem, was built, as so many
other Portuguese castles, by King Diniz, who clearly saw the
importance of Beja as a centre for his “nerves of the republic,”
the peasants of the soil. The whole town is extraordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
picturesque, with no lack of colour in its narrow lanes and
streets. The water-carriers wheel their handcarts with holes
for twenty-four or a dozen jars from far outside the town,
and the peasants go out in troops to till the soil or gather the
harvest, returning at nightfall to Beja’s sheltering walls, as
if some sudden attack of the Moors were to be feared. This
daedal of steep streets enshrines beautiful churches, as that
of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, but it is the streets themselves
and the lovely ruins of Beja that are its chief attraction.
Both the Kings Manoel bore the title of Duke of Beja before
coming to the throne, which is to say, that neither of them
was the heir apparent, this being the title borne by the King’s
second son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evora.</div>

<p>The capital of Alemtejo is Evora, which thus keeps something
of the importance that formerly made it the second
city of Portugal. It has now sunk to a provincial
life, although in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries it figured largely in
Portuguese history as a favourite residence of the Court. It
remains, however, the paradise of the archaeologist and student
of architecture, as it was in the time of André de Resende.
Even before entering the town the old church of São Braz,
of curious and forbidding exterior, arrests the attention.
It is more like a turreted fortification than a church. Within
the walls of the town one comes at every step on some fine
old building or ruin, or rather within what remains of these
magnificent walls. It was at the entrance of the town that
Trancoso in the sixteenth century placed an incident in one
of the most entertaining of his “profitable histories.” The
poor man of his tale, reduced to the extreme of misery, persecuted
by all, and made desperate by such injustice, threw
himself over the battlement. Now it happened that an old
paralysed man was seated taking the sun beneath the wall,
and the poor man fell on top of him. He himself escaped
unhurt, but he killed the old man. Here was another charge
against him, and the old man’s son demanded a life for a life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
The judge was the father of Sancho, of the island of Barataria.
He decreed that the poor man should sit in the chair of the
paralysed and take the sun beneath the wall of Evora, and
that the dead man’s son should throw himself from the wall
on top of him and so kill him. The whole town of Evora
has been described as an archaeological museum, and the
narrow streets sometimes ascending steeply with quaint
wooden arcades on either side, the houses of massive stone
and ironwork and green shutters, the squares and <i>chafarizes</i>
(fountains), the hanging gardens of private houses, and the
public gardens brimming with flowers, the tiny shops, dark
beneath arcades, the fairs and markets, all make of Evora one
of the most peculiar and interesting of cities. And there
is the fine imposing sixteenth-century church of São Francisco,
with its massive exterior walls and pillars, and, inside the
famous chapel, the Room of Bones (<i>Casa dos Ossos</i>)—</p>

<p class="noindent">The early Gothic cathedral was originally finished in 1204,
but is, of course, as it stands, largely of later date. Its interior
contains much fine work of both the sixteenth and eighteenth
centuries. Almost touching it is one of the finest Roman
ruins in existence, the “Temple of Diana,” nearly 2,000 years
old, its magnificent Corinthian columns still supporting massive
blocks of granite. It stands at the top of the town, having
thus little to fear from the encroachment of modern buildings,
and is outlined proudly against the sky. One may hope,
since so many pillars have escaped as by a miracle from the
peril of earthquake, that it may stand there during another
score of centuries and escape destruction and mutilation at
the hands of man, though indeed to the materialist it is as
valueless as a flower, a crimson sunset, or a Cathedral
evensong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Faro.</div>

<p>Faro is nearly two hundred miles due south of Evora,
and between the two towns is all the difference between
serious solid conservative Alemtejo and gay
epicurean Algarve. Faro cannot vie with
Evora in the matter of buildings, it has no
palaces or convents, though it has an interesting little cathedral.
Of the Convent of São Bento only the cloisters survive.
But in its position on the sea, its lines of low houses washed
in many light hues, its inner harbour, like some still sky-reflecting
lagoon, its markets and the shifting scenes that
enliven its streets and <i>praças</i>, it is one of the most charming
of Portugal’s towns, and gives the traveller one of those lively
impressions of contrast in which the whole land of Portugal
abounds. Surely no other combines in so small a space so
many varieties of natural scenery and of architecture.</p>

<span class="smaller">HISTORICAL SURVEY</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Count Henry.</div>

<p>The early, the first five, centuries, of Portugal’s history read
like some enchanting romance of chivalry, a long chain of
heroic deeds by a few great men in an age
when the individual counted for everything.
In Roman history, Viriathus, the chieftain
of the <i>Serra da Estrella</i>, and the Lusitanians under Sertorius
had signalized themselves for their courage and powers of
resistance. But Portugal was but a part of a Roman province—modern
Portugal corresponds only in part to the ancient
Lusitania—nor was it in existence as a separate region when
Count Henry of Burgundy became Count of Portugal in 1095.
The Moors, who had conquered Lisbon three centuries after
the Roman rule in Lusitania came to an end in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 409,
were still in possession, although temporarily ousted by
Alfonso VI, King of León, in 1093. Thus the province
which separated itself from Galicia consisted of a narrow
tract with wavering borders between the Minho and the
Tagus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso I.</div>

<p>Count Henry had extended its southern frontier before he
died in 1112, but it was his son Affonso Henriques, who, by
his mighty deeds of war, really established
the kingdom. Santarem was taken in 1147,
and in the same year, with the help of English
and other Crusaders, Lisbon. His mother, the Countess
Theresa, was Regent from 1112 to 1128, but in the latter
year he took over the reins of power. For the first year of
his rule he was at war with Castille, but soon all his energies
were directed against the Moors, and the battle of Ourique,
before which Christ was supposed to have appeared to the
Infante, promising him victory, definitely turned the scales<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
in favour of the Christians (1139). Henceforth he was known
as King of Portugal, a title conferred perhaps on the battlefield
of Ourique and confirmed at the Cortes of Lamego (1143).
The King’s untiring energy had the great incentive that whatever
territory he won from the Moors he held in his own right,
and if this territory became greater than that originally held
in fealty to León, Portugal would almost naturally become
independent. His prudence seems to have matched his
valour, and he parried the claims of León by making Portugal
tributary to the Pope. In 1184, after nearly sixty years of
warfare, begun in 1128 against his own mother in order to
obtain his kingdom, the old King was once more in arms,
with the object of relieving his son, besieged in Santarem
by the Moors. He died in the following year, in great honour
and glory. The King had made the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sancho I.</div>

<p>His son, Sancho I, second King of Portugal (1185-1211),
and perhaps also her first poet (in a poem addressed to the
fair Maria Paes), had proved himself in his
youth worthy of his father’s great reputation.
The conquest of the south of the Peninsula
from the Moors continued. Silves was taken in 1189, retaken
by the Moors in 1191. But Sancho did not confine himself
to war: he founded towns and encouraged agriculture to
such an extent that he became known as the <i>Lavrador</i> or the
<i>Poblador</i>. In his reign occurred the first disagreement
between Church and State, which was soon to grow to so
serious a conflict. The religious orders for their past and
prospective services against the Moors had received huge
grants of land from his father and from King Sancho himself.
Often an Order would be given the whole of a vast tract of
land still unconquered from the Moors. It seemed a little
thing at the time, but when conquered and cultivated, made
the possessors as powerful as the King or more so. King
Sancho, however, left a prosperous kingdom at his death. By
his will he bequeathed certain important towns to his daughters
absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso II.</div>

<p>Their brother, King Affonso II, refused to waive his right
to these towns, and the first years of his reign were occupied
with civil war, while it ended in a first serious
disagreement with the Clergy and Rome.
The most welcome event of his reign was the
capture of the strongly fortified town of Alcacer do Sal
from the Moors in 1217, with the help of Crusaders who
had sheltered in the Tagus and sailed up the Sado to the
attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sancho II.</div>

<p>In the reign of his son, Sancho II (1223-46), the strife with
the Clergy developed and the powerful nobility took part
against the King, the dissatisfaction being
fanned apparently by the report that the
King intended to marry his distant cousin,
Mecia Lopes de Haro, daughter of the Lord of Biscay. The
King, who had continued the conquest of Algarve, and won
the important town of Tavira, was powerless to withstand the
forces united against him. A deputation of Portuguese
prelates and nobles waited on the Pope at Lyon, and persuaded
him to depose King Sancho, or rather to appoint his brother
Affonso as Regent. The cynical and ambitious Affonso
had been long resident in France, and he now accepted
the offer with some alacrity, taking whatever oaths were
required of him before he set out for Portugal. The King
fled at his approach, and died two years later an exile at
Toledo (1248).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso III.</div>

<p>As he was childless, Affonso was his natural successor.
His ambitions realised, he made a good king—he seems to
have had great personal attractions—and
continued successful in all his undertakings.
The conquest of Algarve was completed,
Faro, facing out towards Africa, falling to the King in 1249.
A dispute between Affonso III and Alfonso X, the Learned,
of Castille, arose out of these Portuguese victories in Algarve.
The Guadiana was not yet a boundary between Spain and
Portugal, and it seemed as if the victorious Portuguese might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
eventually deprive Castille of the potential possession of the
whole southern strip of the Peninsula, even to Almería.
A treaty settled their differences in 1253. By this treaty
Affonso III was to marry Brites, illegitimate daughter of
Alfonso X. The wedding, as well as the bride, was illegitimate,
for the Portuguese King was already married to the French
Countess Mathilde. The dowry now offered was a glittering
temptation, and the Pope, who excommunicated Affonso III
for bigamy, should have included in his ban the Castilian
monarch, fellow-conspirator with Affonso in this wickedness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diniz.</div>

<p>When Affonso died his eldest son, Diniz or Denis (1279-1325)
was in his eighteenth year. Owing to the illness of his
father—bedridden for years before his death—he
had early taken a part in affairs. Indeed,
at the age of six, we find him a full-blown
diplomatist, sent on a mission—connected with the independence
of Algarve—to his grandfather, King Alfonso the
Learned, at Seville. As King, his activities were many-sided,
and in all of them he showed the same strong will and good
sense, always directed towards the strengthening of Portugal,
and making the interests of throne and people one. The
quarrel between the State and the Church in Portugal, backed
by the Vatican, which had caused his father to die excommunicate,
continued, but by an attitude of equal firmness
and justice. King Diniz contrived to bring about a settlement,
and to check the acquisition of real property by the religious
orders. The same firm hand dealt with the overweening
nobility. Some discontent was felt among the nobles, and
Diniz’ real popularity was with the workmen, peasants, and
small farmers, whose interests he so unflaggingly protected.
Throughout the country he built and rebuilt walls and towns
and towers, and encouraged the cultivators of the soil as
“the nerves of the republic.” He founded in 1290 at Lisbon
the University, which after several removals from Lisbon to
Coimbra and from Coimbra to Lisbon, is now definitely fixed
at Coimbra. And, as if he foresaw all Portugal’s destined task<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and glory, he encouraged ship-building, imported an admiral
for his fleet from Genoa, and planted the country about
Leiria with pines. As a poet he has left us a greater number
of lyrics than any other early king, with the exception, perhaps,
of his grandfather of Castille. And he wrote them not only
in the Provençal manner, but characteristically encouraged
the indigenous poetry derived from the soil of Galicia. He was
a thorough Portuguese, and ruled over a clearly defined region
with the boundaries of modern Portugal. The first years
of his reign were clouded by civil strife with his brother,
who based a claim to the Crown on the fact that Diniz was
born before the Countess Mathilde died, and his last years
were saddened by disagreement with his eldest son. This
only did not come to battles even more serious than those
actually fought owing to the untiring mediation of King
Diniz’ wife, the Queen Saint Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso IV.</div>

<p>King Diniz, the <i>Lavrador</i>, was reconciled to and succeeded
by this son, Affonso IV. Under Affonso the relations with
Castille became more and more frequent, and
in 1340 the Portuguese King and the flower
of the Portuguese chivalry helped to win
the great battle of Salado against the Moors. Affonso IV,
who had embittered his father’s last years, suffered in turn at
the hands of his son. It must be allowed that Pedro had
some excuse, for the King had sanctioned the murder, during
his son’s absence, of the mother of Pedro’s three children, the
lovely Inés de Castro. Maddened with grief, Pedro harassed
his father’s realm with fire and sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pedro I.</div>

<p>This sorrow seems to have increased the eccentricity of his
character, so that at times there seemed a streak of madness.
It was he who thrashed the Bishop of Porto,
it was he who condemned a stonecutter who
had killed a man to the same sentence as a
priest who had killed a man: after ascertaining that the
priest had been forbidden to say mass as punishment, he
sternly forbade the stonecutter to cut any more stones. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
was grim humour in many of the sentences of this <i>Rei Justiceiro</i>,
and they were always directed against the powerful, the
nobility, the clergy, the King’s officials in favour of the weak
and unprotected, so that the people sang his praises. He
seems to have had something of his grandfather, King Diniz’,
art of popularity without his high sense of dignity. Pedro’s
passion was for the dance and to the blowing of his long silver
trumpets he would dance through the streets of Lisbon by
night or day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fernando I.</div>

<p>After a reign of ten years (1357-67) he was succeeded by the
reckless and irresponsible Fernando, who contrived during his
reign of sixteen years to squander the great
wealth built up by the Kings of Portugal
since Affonso III. He must needs lay claim
to the Crown of Castille, and in a series of unnecessary wars
brought his kingdom to the verge of ruin. Lisbon was
besieged by land and sea by the Castilians in 1373. The
King’s unpopularity was increased by his marriage with the
wily and unscrupulous Leonor Telles. It was in this reign
that occurred the murder of the beautiful and innocent Maria
Telles, at the hands of her own husband, brother of the King
and son of murdered Inés, by instigation of her sister Leonor.
Her fate has been less celebrated than that of Inés, but had
no less of tragedy and pathos. During the whole of the
fourteenth century a succession of double marriages between
the royal families of Castille and Portugal increased the mutual
familiarity, if not friendliness, of the two countries. Finally,
to crown the impolicy of his whole reign, Fernando married
his daughter Beatrice to King Juan I of Castille in the year
1383, thereby almost irretrievably assuring Portugal’s union
with or rather subjection to Castille. He had previously
settled to marry her to nearly every prince in Europe, but
did not consider himself bound by treaties. To him they
were mere scraps of paper. The old-fashioned German
historian, Heinrich Schäfer, writing in 1835, says that “neither
duty nor honour could bind him” to respect them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">João I.</div>

<p>His widow, Queen Leonor, stood for the cause of Castille,
wishing the Portuguese throne for her daughter and son-in-law.
After her favourite, João Fernandes Andeiro,
Count of Ourem, had been murdered almost
before her eyes in the palace, and popular
excesses at Lisbon, Evora and other towns had fully showed the
danger of her position, she retired from Lisbon and joined the
Spanish invader. Early in 1384 King Juan I was at Santarem,
styling himself King of Castille, León and Portugal. Thus
Portugal was ruled at one and the same time by two Kings
John I, for the Infante João, Master of Aviz, illegitimate son
of King Pedro, and intensely popular, especially at Lisbon,
was now king in all but name. Many of the Portuguese
nobility favoured the cause of Castille, and King Juan I
appeared to have good chance of ultimate victory. Queen
Leonor soon found that she had exchanged one difficult
position for another. She was virtually a prisoner in the
King’s hands, and was finally relegated to the Convent of
Tordesillas. The Castilians besieged Lisbon closely by land
and sea, and only the plague in their ranks brought relief to
the starving city. On the 6th of April, 1385, the Infante João
was formally chosen King of Portugal. His chief supporter
was, like Napoleon, worth a whole army. Others might waver,
but in Nun’ Alvares’ straight and clear mind loyalty to Queen
Leonor, who was held to have forfeited loyalty, could not
weigh for an instant against his love of an independent
Portugal. To secure that, he said, he would fight against his
own father. Against his brother he did fight, and no suspicion
of the loyalty of the Constable, not long out of his teens, could
be instilled into the mind of his friend João I, who rewarded
him for his victories with well-nigh half his kingdom. The
first great Portuguese victory was at Trancoso in July, 1385,
followed on the 15th of August by the battle near Aljubarrota,
in which the flower of the Spanish nobility, and of Portuguese
nobles fighting on the side of Castille, fell. It was a victory of
King and people over the nobility. King Juan fled in haste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
to Santarem, and thence to Spain. Nun’ Alvares in October
won another great victory at Valverde, and after that there
was little more fear of serious Spanish invasion. Fighting,
however, went on at intervals, till a truce in 1389 was followed
by a more permanent truce in 1400, and by a treaty of peace
in 1411, after the death of King Juan’s successor, Henrique III.
The last great achievement of King João I’s great reign was the
conquest of Ceuta. The expedition was saddened at its
outset by the death of the Queen, of plague, a few days before
the King and his three older sons, Duarte, Pedro, Henrique,
sailed on their crusade against the Moors (1415). The expedition
was completely successful. Ceuta was taken immediately
owing to the eager heroism of the Princes and their Portuguese
followers. This was the first of Portugal’s great deeds beyond
the seas. The last years of King João I’s reign were peaceful,
and when he died in 1433, two years after the death of his
life-long friend, Nun’ Alvares, Portugal was as independent as
Spain or any other country, and her alliance with England
already ancient and secure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duarte.</div>

<p>King Duarte (1433-8) himself married an Aragonese princess,
another Leonor. In spite of his good sense and great qualities,
in spite of his personal courage amply shown
in the expedition against Ceuta, his combination
of king and philosopher was not entirely
successful. He had the weakness to yield to the fiery determination
of his brother, Infante Henrique, to send a force
against Tangiers. The expedition ended disastrously (had it
been a success there would, of course, be no talk of King
Duarte’s weakness). After thirty-seven days of heroic fighting
against vast numbers of Moors, the Portuguese were forced
to surrender. In return for permission to sail back without
their arms, to Portugal, they agreed to give up Ceuta, and the
Infante Fernando remained as hostage and died a prisoner
after many months of fearful ill-treatment. His brother,
King Duarte, had died before him, leaving his wife, Queen
Leonor, Regent for the infant King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso V.</div>

<p>Another of his brothers, the Infante Pedro, soon became
Regent, while another, the Infante Henrique, now known as
the Navigator, was preparing Portugal’s
future glory with a faith and persistency rarely
surpassed. At his bidding and under his
direction, Portuguese mariners crept down the west coast of
Africa, and at his death in 1460 he had cause to feel that his
labours had not been in vain, and that a rich field for the
merchant and the missionary would yearly extend. The
discovery of the Cape of Good Hope followed, and in 1497-9,
when Vasco da Gama, rounding the Cape, crossed from East
Africa to India, and returned in triumph to Lisbon, this
successful enterprise was felt to be, and indeed was, the crown
and natural outcome of Prince Henry’s life-work. He was
the last of that noble galaxy of brothers. When the Infante
Pedro, answering to the wishes of a great part of the kingdom,
and especially of the people of Lisbon, assumed the Regency,
he ruled firmly and wisely (1438-47), and did not, therefore,
make the fewer enemies. Queen Leonor died in 1445, and
two years later the young King took power into his own hands.
No sooner had Pedro ceased to be Regent than his enemies
combined for his ruin, and the King, his nephew, and son-in-law,
an amiable but weak young man, was induced to listen
to their accusations. The Infante Pedro was banished from
the Court, and was given no opportunity of defending himself.
The matter finally came to open war, and the King’s large
army met the Infante Pedro’s small force at Alfarrobeira in
May, 1449. The Infante was killed in a preliminary skirmish.
Affonso V (1438-81), gifted with a noble and generous
character, as king proved at once weak and obstinate. An
extant letter from him to the historian Azurara shows him in
a very pleasant light. In his external policy he had two
chief aims, to conquer North-West Africa, and to make good
his claim to the Crown of Castille. As to the first he obtained
some measure of success, so that flatterers called him the
“African.” Alcacer was taken in 1458, Tangiers thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
years later. But the last ten years of his reign had no victories
to show. He espoused the cause of Juana, daughter of Henry
IV, King of Castille, making it his own by betrothing himself
to her (<i>a excellente Senhora</i>). War with Castille followed,
and he was defeated at the battle of Toro (1476). He was not
more successful in his attempt to obtain the support of France.
In his visit to the French Court he was a puppet in the hands
of the astute Louis XI, and when he returned to Portugal it
was felt that he had failed doubly. Indeed, he had renounced
the throne and decided to retire to a convent, but he now
reassumed his position as king, although the real power and
direction of affairs remained in the vigorous and able hands
of his son João. Before Affonso V died, João had effected a
peace with Castille (1479), by which the hapless Juana was

<p>Affonso V had always been man first and king by an after-thought,
his son João II was always king first. In his reign
(1481-95) the royal power was strengthened
and made supreme in Portugal. This was indeed
the outstanding feature of the rule of the
“Perfect Prince,” in whose strong hands Portugal reached the
height of her strength, though not of her glory. The most
powerful Portuguese subject was the Duke of Braganza, who
owned a third of Portugal, or more. The founder of this house
was an illegitimate son of João I, married to the daughter of
Nun’ Alvares, who had received from the King a large proportion
of the towns and territories conquered by his skill and
energy in battle. The Duke of Braganza was now arrested by
João II and executed at Evora as a friend of Castille, but essentially
as a too powerful vassal of Portugal. Part of the nobility,
disaffected owing to the King’s strenuous proceedings, and the
Bishop of Evora involved the Duke of Vizeu in a plot to dethrone
his brother-in-law, although, as it proved, he would
have become king in the natural course of events a few years
later. King João II’s son, Prince Affonso, married in 1490 to
Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings, died in the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
year at the age of sixteen. The Duke of Vizeu’s plot was
betrayed to the King, who acted with his usual energy and
decision. His brother-in-law he stabbed to death with his own
hand. The other principal conspirators were sentenced to
imprisonment or death. The title of the Duke of Vizeu was
extinguished, but his younger brother, Manoel, became heir to
the throne with the title of Duke of Beja.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manoel I.</div>

<p>As King Manoel, the Fortunate, he ruled over Portugal for
twenty-six years (1495-1521), a period which will always be
considered the greatest of Portugal’s prosperity
and glory, as well as the golden age of
her literature (although her greatest poet,
Camões, was unborn when King Manoel died). The fruits of
the labours of the Infante Henrique, of King João II, of a long
line of glorious or obscure heroes and adventurers and administrators
from the time of King Diniz now fell into the mouth
of King Manoel. Compared with his predecessor on the
throne, he has been aptly described as an orange-tree succeeding
an oak. But it must not be supposed that he was without
energy, witness the speed with which he prepared to rescue
Arzilla in 1508, and the fact that he would be up and at work
when most of his subjects were still asleep in their beds. But
what astonishes and must ever astonish the world is the
mighty achievement of this tiny kingdom. The series of
wars with Castille, of adventures along the west coast of Africa,
of battles in Morocco, of internal troubles, might seem to
justify and explain a period of complete inactivity. Yet in
the years that followed the Portuguese conquered not one
country or one province, but a whole world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portugal’s World-Empire.</div>

<p>To tell the wonderful story of the Portuguese discoveries, culminating
in the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu
Diaz and the voyage of a handful of
Portuguese under Vasco da Gama, and how
the Portuguese Empire in the East was
defended by such heroes as Duarte Pacheco Pereira, and
strengthened and extended by the indomitable Affonso<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
d’Albuquerque, would fill volumes. The tiny Portuguese
nation provided men to do these deeds, and also historians to
record them worthily. Sometimes the hero was himself author,
and wrote with a directness and vigour of style scarcely
ever attained by Portuguese writers of to-day. Only half a
century elapsed between the voyage of Vasco da Gama and
the death of D. João de Castro in India in 1548, and into this
brief period is crowded a bewildering array of fighters, writers,
poets, historians, administrators, men of science, to such an
extent that no brief summary of Portuguese history can even
record their names. But large tracts of Asia and Africa now
acknowledged Portugal’s sway, and all the kings of the East
sent costly presents, gold and spices and precious stones, to
their suzerain in the West. The name and fame of the
Portuguese extended throughout all lands in mixed fear and
admiration. Foreign adventurers and merchants and men
of curiosity and learning flocked to Lisbon, which for a brief
space appeared as the true centre of the universe. The Pope
and Cardinals in Rome gazed in wonder at the unprecedented
gifts from the East sent by the King of Portugal. But not
in the East only were great deeds performed at this time by
the Portuguese, for in North-West Africa D. João de Menezes
won undying glory by his brilliant military achievements,
taking Larache, Azamor (1519), and other towns. When we
read that in a single day—in the defence of a fortress they
were building in North Africa—1,200 Portuguese are said
to have fallen, and know that this was a comparatively
unimportant link in the huge chain of empire which Affonso
d’Albuquerque (the fear of whose name penetrated far into
China) was even then (1515) forging in India, we are not
surprised that agriculture in Portugal was neglected and that
two generations later King Sebastian could only collect a force
of 9,000 Portuguese to accompany him to Africa. Rather we
marvel how Portugal could continue so long to sustain efforts
so many and so various. For a skilful historian the story of
Portugal in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries affords an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
epic subject more wonderful than perhaps any in history—except
that of the events exactly four centuries later which
welded together another empire and again saw all the Princes
of India sending gifts to the West. And the materials to the
hand of such an historian are fascinating and abundant, both
published and manuscript. Unfortunately the age of King
Manoel did not provide a fresh crop of heroes equal to those
who had grown to manhood under King João II, and when he
died in 1521 the disquieting symptoms were many. In
Portugal the real prosperity had been replaced by a garish
and deceptive luxury, and the old simple pleasures and jollity
had vanished with the old austerity of life. In the East the
mighty compelling arm of Affonso d’Albuquerque had sunk
to rest in 1515. King Manoel had married as his first wife
Isabel, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. She died in childbirth,
and their son Miguel died two years later in 1500.
Had he lived he would have succeeded not only to the throne
and mighty empire of his father, King Manoel, but to the
throne and mighty empire of the Catholic Kings. Such a
load of empire would seem too great for the shoulders of one
ruler to bear, and in the very year of the infant prince’s death
the Portuguese Pedro Alvares Cabral’s discovery, or rediscovery,
of Brazil added another huge item to the burden and
the glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">João III.</div>

<p>King Manoel was succeeded by his son, João III (1521-57),
born in 1502. To the oak and the orange succeeded the
cypress. But the gloom of his reign has been
much exaggerated, and the King’s character
wilfully distorted by the historians, who have
described him as a bigot and a witless idiot. King João was
no fool, and had an intelligent love of letters, and, if the Court
was now less given up to pleasure than in the reign of his
predecessor, we still read of <i>serões</i> continuing at the palace
during several nights. But the power of Rome in Portugal
certainly grew in his reign, and a succession of personal
sorrows increased his devotion to religion. About fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
years after his accession many of his nearest relations died,
and, although a son and heir to his throne survived till 1554,
his death in that year came to crown the many griefs of this
reign. This precocious boy, the Infante João, had already
won some fame as a patron of letters, and was married when
he died at the age of sixteen. His death was one of the
greatest misfortunes of Portuguese history, from which indeed
the goddess of Good Fortune seems to have departed in the
first half of the sixteenth century, leaving in her place a poor
Mofina Mendes, personification of ill luck. King João III
and his brother Henrique had worked persistently to introduce
the Inquisition into Portugal, and the Company of Jesuits,
destined to do excellent work in education at home and in the
colonies overseas, also came to Portugal during his reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sebastian.</div>

<p>Prince João’s infant son, Sebastian, born in 1554, was
educated by priests and Jesuits, and in 1562 his grand-uncle
Henrique, priest first and prince afterwards,
succeeded Queen Catharina as Regent, and
continued to rule till the King came of age
(14) in 1568. King Sebastian reigned in person for ten years.
His character and capacities have been much discussed. To a
love of sport and all dangerous enterprises, he united a deep
religiousness, instilled into him by his education, and a consuming
desire to extend the Christian faith and win personal
glory by a victory over the Moors in Africa. To this end the
ten years of his reign were directed, and in 1578 he sailed from
Lisbon (25th June), with a force of about 14,000, Portuguese
and foreigners, including members of all the noblest families
in Portugal. Surrounded by a vastly superior number of
Moors in the battle of Alcacer Kebir (4th August, 1578), the
majority of the Portuguese were slain or taken prisoners.
The King himself, a Don Quixote before Don Quixote was
born, died fighting valiantly. His body was recovered later
and sent to Spain and thence to Portugal, where it was buried
in the convent of Belem, built by his great-grandfather, King
Manoel. Yet in the confusion of that battle many rumours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
arose and the people in Portugal never believed in his death,
a fact which occasioned various episodes in the following year,
and was the basis of a kind of religious faith which lasted on
into the nineteenth century. Not quite two centuries had
passed since the battle of Aljubarrota, and into that period
the Portuguese had crowded a history more brilliant than that
of any other country. Now it seemed as if the ship had gone
by, leaving only a wake of troubled water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henrique.</div>

<p>Sebastião was succeeded by his great-uncle Henrique,
Cardinal at 33, and King at 66, who, however, only
survived him for a few months, dying in
1580. His last days were embittered by the
question of the succession. Seven pretenders
claimed the Crown of Portugal, and chiefly the Duke of
Braganza, in his wife’s right, Antonio, Prior of Crato, the
Lisbon people’s favourite, and King Philip II of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip II of Spain.</div>

<p>The right seems to have been doubtful, but the might was
on the side of King Philip, who made no secret of his resolution
to win the kingdom by force if it were not
given to him willingly. Many of the Portuguese
nobility were on his side, and the
King Cardinal was finally induced to recognise his claim. But
the people strongly resented the intrusion of the Spaniard,
and the Prior of Crato found no difficulty in having himself
proclaimed King at Santarem. When, however, King Philip’s
army, under the Duke of Alba, arrived at Setubal, and after
taking Cascaes, advanced on Lisbon, Antonio’s forces, encamped
outside the capital, melted away—they consisted of untrained
citizens for the most part—and Antonio himself fled into
Lisbon and thence to Oporto and Vianna in the North. From
Vianna do Castello he escaped in disguise by sea, accompanied
by the Bishop of Guarda and the Conde do Vimioso (October,
1580). He did not, however, yet leave Portugal, remaining
disguised there and even at times at Lisbon till June, 1581,
when he retired to France. Philip II had entered Portugal by
Elvas, and was received as king without further resistance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
making a solemn entry into Lisbon, the fourth king of Portugal
in the last three years. A French fleet was sent to the Azores
in favour of Antonio, but was defeated. He made a last
fruitless effort in 1589 in combination with Drake, who took
the town of Cascaes. There was no support forthcoming in
Portugal, and the Prior de Crato returned to France, and died
there a few years later. If Philip II expected now to rule over
Portugal in peace he had mistaken the character of his new
subjects. Antonio was dead, King Sebastian dead and buried
at Belem, but in the wishes and thoughts of the people King
Sebastian was alive and might be expected to return from one
day to another. Pretenders accordingly abounded and gave
considerable trouble; one, especially, who appeared in Italy,
bore so striking a resemblance to Sebastian, and displayed
knowledge of matters which only Sebastian could, apparently,
have known, that to this day some believe him to have been
the real king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish Domination (Philip II-IV 1580-1640).</div>

<p>But Portugal was now definitely wedded to Castille for the
next sixty years. Spain’s enemies became her enemies, and
her great colonial empire lay at their mercy.
Before the end of the century the Dutch were
in the East, and like rats in cheese, battened
on the possessions of the Portuguese. A few
years later the English followed. All the
old daring and enterprise of the Portuguese mariners of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries seemed to have fallen from
them like the cloak of Elijah. Their ships were used in the
service of Spain, and their own overseas dominions left
unprotected. Lisbon, accustomed to see the fleets depart
and come in traffics and discoveries from the East, now watched
the building of the invincible Armada against her old ally
England. But Philip II’s hand was a strong hand, and not
lightly to be shaken off by an exhausted people. Under the
rule of his successors it was otherwise. Hollow pomp took
the place of real power, and the concentration of affairs in the
King’s hands, or in those of his minister, required men of more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
insight and astuteness than Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal)
or the Count-Duke Olivares possessed. In Portugal discontent
was widespread. The people had never willingly
accepted Spanish rule, and the increased burden of taxation
did not lessen their dislike. The nobles, even if they were not
fired by the misfortunes of their country, were enraged by
slights inflicted upon themselves. Margaret, Duchess of
Mantua, had been appointed Regent of Portugal in 1634.
The real power was in the hands of Miguel de Vasconcellos,
who concentrated in his own person all the hatred of the
Portuguese for the Spaniard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Restoration.</div>

<p>In 1640, forty nobles, sure of the support of the people, and
encouraged by the enthusiastic approbation of the Archbishop
of Lisbon, decided that the hour had come
to throw off the hated yoke. The Duke of
Braganza’s agent, João Pinto Ribeiro, was
the heart and soul of the conspiracy. The secret was well kept.
<i>Fu cosa meravigliosa il concerto</i>, says an Italian historian.
The Countess of Atouguia, Filippa de Vilhena, who had
knowledge of the plot, herself armed her two young sons to
take part in it on the 1st of December. As nine o’clock
struck that morning the conspirator nobles forced their way
into the palace and proclaimed the King, João IV, Duke of
Braganza.</p>

<div class="sidenote">João IV.</div>

<p>He was the grandson of the Duchess Catharina, one of the
claimants to the Portuguese throne on the death of the
Cardinal King. Spain, with burdens not
less great than her vast resources, and the
revolt of Catalonia on her hands, was unable
to do more for the moment than encourage plots in Portugal
against the new King. The most serious of them was a conspiracy
to kill the King, of which the Archbishop of Braga
was the organiser in 1641. The Vatican gave its support to
Spain and connived at this conspiracy. King João IV was
too deeply religious to take the opportunity to free the Church—and
State—in Portugal from the supremacy of Rome, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
foreign policy generally was not marked by the strength which
the circumstances required. His foreign ministers had
extraordinarily difficult tasks. In the year after the Restoration,
treaties were made with France and Holland, and the
alliance with England was renewed. But the custom to
plunder Portugal’s overseas territories was now inveterate,
and she derived little profit from her new allies, although a
common cause united them against Spain. The Dutch gave
the Portuguese fair words in Europe and hard blows in her
colonies, and Portugal was powerless to do more than protest
with words against such double dealing. Actual war between
Spain and Portugal began in 1643, and continued desultorily
till 1646, when it was broken off till the death of King John IV
in 1656. King João’s brother, the Infante Duarte, had been
arrested by order of Philip II as soon as news came of the
Restoration in 1640, and was subjected to a process of slow
murder till he died in prison in 1649, a second Infante Fernando,
only that his gaoler was no prince of Fez but the
Catholic King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affonso VI.</div>

<p>King João’s eldest son, Theodosio, who had shown great
promise, also died before him, aged nineteen and the
second son, Affonso, succeeded at the age of
thirteen. Although completely uneducated
and incapable of affairs, he wrested the power
out of his mother’s hands six years later. Affonso VI is said
to have been more at home in the company of grooms than
in that of statesmen, but fortunately at the beginning of his
reign he had an affection for a statesman of strong and wise
views, the Conde de Castello Melhor, and allowed himself to
be guided by his counsels. There seems no reason to think
that he would not have continued to rely on ministers as
excellent, and in that case his reign might have ended as
prosperously as it began. But dissensions at Court deprived
him first of Castello Melhor, then of his capable successor,
Antonio Sousa de Macedo, and without them he was helpless.
The Queen, a daughter of the Duc de Nemours, insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
taking part, and no minor part, in affairs, was determined, in
fact, to govern Portugal in the interests of Louis XIV. The
strife between her and Castello Melhor was open and continuous
till the Secretary of State fell. The King’s brother,
the Infante Pedro, who must have known better than most
how the country would gain if King Affonso had a wise
minister at his elbow, supported the cause of the Queen.
He forced Sousa de Macedo to flee from the palace to save his
life, and when the King was thus left defenceless, obliged him
to resign (November, 1667) and proceeded to marry the
Queen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pedro II.</div>

<p>He did not himself assume the title of King but used that
of “Governor” until the death of the King, who had been
sent to the island of Terceira and then brought
to Cintra, where he died in 1683. (The
Queen, his former wife, died in the same year.)
During these internal affairs events had happened which were
of vast importance for Portugal. The war with Spain had at
first been favourable to Spain, but three years after Affonso VI
came to the throne the Spanish were decisively defeated at
Elvas, and four years later, in 1663, the Portuguese under the
leadership of the Count of Schomberg, achieved the victory
of Ameixial, by which Portugal really established her independence.
The capture of Elvas and the victory of Montes
Claros followed. These were good answers to the exclusion
of Portugal from the peace between Louis XIV and Spain
in 1659. The Restoration of Charles II brought about renewed
relations of friendliness between England and Portugal.
A fresh treaty was signed between the two countries in May,
1661, and Englishmen (as well as Frenchmen) fought at
Ameixial. Negotiations for peace with Holland began in
the same year, and were brought to a successful issue in 1662,
although, owing to new conflicts in India, the Portuguese and
Dutch were not really at peace till 1669. Finally, in 1666,
negotiations for peace were carried on between Spain and
Portugal. They were, however, broken off, and in 1667 a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
treaty was signed, not between Portugal and Spain, but between
Portugal and France. However, in 1668, the war with Spain,
which had lasted for over a quarter of a century, ended, and
peace was concluded between the two countries. Ceuta
remained in the hands of the Spanish. This was unhappily
the fate of many of Portugal’s overseas possessions. She
lost or pawned one jewel after another till her splendid
heirlooms were reduced, not indeed to insignificance, but to
insignificance in comparison with their former worth. She
did at least succeed in recovering Brazil from the Dutch.
Pedro II, who ruled as Regent from 1656 to 1683, and as King
from 1683 to 1706, was little better educated than his unfortunate
brother, but he proved a wise and capable statesman
with the good of his country constantly at heart. If personal
ambition seemed to mark the first events of his public life,
he redeemed these faults by a real devotion to Portuguese
interests, and under his rule Portugal again attained a degree
of importance which was clearly shown at the beginning of the
War of the Spanish Succession, when all the European Powers
eagerly sought her assistance. Portugal at first maintained
her neutrality, and, not for the last time in her history, bobbed
and wavered like a cork between conflicting waves. But
before Pedro II died he had set the seal on his wisdom by
openly throwing in his lot with England and her Allies (May,
1703). As events proved, the other course would have meant
Portugal’s ruin. The same year, 1703, witnessed the signing
of an important and much discussed commercial treaty
between Great Britain and Portugal, known as the Methuen
Treaty (27th December). It provided that Portuguese wines
should be admitted to Great Britain at reduced rates (a third
less than those upon French wines), and that as regards the
prohibition of the importation of manufactured woollen goods
into Portugal an exception should be made in the case of Great
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">João V.</div>

<p>João V was but seventeen when he began his reign of forty-four
years in 1706. His noble qualities and lofty aims were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
marred by the grandiose taste of the time and by an unwise imitation
of the <i>Roi Soleil</i>. He wished to be the Portuguese Louis
XIV. He lavishly encouraged art and science,
and took personal and intelligent interest in
their progress. He acted generally with a
magnificence befitting a lord of all Europe, or at least of all
the possessions in the East that had once been Portugal’s,
whereas his treasury was supplied mainly by gold from
Brazil. In the matter of buildings, especially, his extravagance
was unbridled, and two of them, the Convent of Mafra and the
Alcantara Aqueduct, still excite wonder and admiration. It
was all very splendid, and very unwise when agriculture at
home and the development of the colonies abroad as well as
a fleet to maintain them required every available penny. The
principal event of his reign in foreign affairs was the peace of
Utrecht, signed between France, Spain, and Portugal in 1713.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph I.</div>

<p>His successor, Joseph I (1750-77) might perhaps have
reigned in Portugal as a Philip IV of Spain, and been known
chiefly for his love of the theatre had he not
possessed a minister far wiser and abler than
Olivares. This minister, Sebastião José de
Carvalho e Mello, Marquez de Pombal, born in 1699, had been
Ambassador in London (1739-45), and then at Vienna before
becoming Joseph I’s Secretary of State. A terrible event on
the 1st of November, 1755, proved his decision, calmness, and
energy. At 9 a.m. on the morning of that day an earthquake
of unparalleled severity set Lisbon in ruins in the space of a
quarter of an hour. Slighter shocks continued to terrify the
inhabitants—the survivors (between 25,000 and 30,000 had
perished) during the next two months. That the consequences
were not even more disastrous and that the population
did not get wholly out of hand was due to one man—Pombal.
His plan for rebuilding the city was not carried to completion,
but the regular streets and squares of the lower part of Lisbon,
the <i>Baixa</i>, still attest his energy and foresight. The other event
with which his name is chiefly associated is the expulsion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the Jesuits whose power had been steadily growing in Portugal
and her colonies for the last two centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pombal.</div>

<p>To this end Pombal’s great energies were for years directed,
although he found time in some measure to give attention to
the more important objects of agriculture,
education, etc. An attempt on the King’s life
on the 3rd of September, 1758, in which the
King was wounded in the arm, gave Pombal his opportunity
against the Jesuits, who were accused of being the promoters
(<i>impulsores</i>) of the plot. First the Duke of Aveiro, as the chief
conspirator, was executed with horrible cruelty, worthy of the
twentieth century, at Belem. The Count of Atouguia and the
family of Tavora, the Marquez de Tavora, who had recently
returned from ruling Portuguese India as Viceroy, his noble
and witty wife and their two sons, were executed with him.
They were probably all innocent. Their ashes were thrown into
the Tagus, their arms crossed out from among the noble families
of Portugal. Then, exactly a year after the attempt, the
Jesuits were banished from Portugal and her colonies (3rd
September, 1759), and their goods confiscated (25th February,
1761). Relations between Portugal and the Vatican were
broken off and were not resumed until 1770 after prolonged
negotiations and the death of Pope Clement XIII. His successor,
Clement XIV, extinguished the Society of Jesus (August,
1773). Soon after King José’s death the Marquez de Pombal
retired to the village of Pombal, and died there five years later
in 1782, in his 83rd year. Ambitious to obtain power and
merciless in its use, he was, undoubtedly, a man of strong will
and enlightened views (he condemned slavery and protected
the Jews), but he was unattractive and often unjust in his
methods. He is sometimes spoken of as if he were the only
enlightened ruler of the eighteenth century in Portugal,
whereas both the preceding and succeeding reigns were marked
by a steady progress and culture. King João V gave a strong
impulsion to literature and science: and in the reign of King
José’s daughter, Queen Maria I, the first roads worthy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
name were built. In Pombal’s methods we may perhaps see the
germ of that embitterment in Portugal which has manifested
itself in open or latent civil war almost ever since.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maria I.</div>

<p>At the end of the century Portugal’s prosperity stood high.
In 1792, owing to the Queen’s failing reason, her son João
took over the reins of government. The
Queen lived till 1816, and the Regent then
became King João VI till his death ten years
later. The greater part of his rule, as Regent and King, was
fraught with a series of disasters which from prosperity dashed
Portugal into distress and despair, and threatened her very
existence as a nation. The two causes which contributed
most to her ruin were the invasion of Portugal by the French
armies of Napoleon, and the declaration of the independence
of Brazil, with which Portugal had hitherto had a monopoly
of trade. Portugal, as England’s ally, and the possessor of
excellent seaports, could not hope to escape Napoleon’s
attention. In vain she attempted to maintain her neutrality,
even to the extent of wishing to close her harbours against
and yet remain the ally of Great Britain. But the treaty of
Fontainebleau in October, 1807, between Napoleon and
Godoy, made it clear that whatever hope there was for Portugal
consisted in her old alliance. By this treaty Portugal
was to be divided into three parts, and to cease to be an
independent country. Junot advanced rapidly upon Lisbon,
and the Regent and Royal Family set sail for Brazil, accompanied
by many of the noble and wealthy families of Portugal.
The land of Portugal itself remained for years the scene of
warfare, for, although the convention of Cintra in 1808 freed it
from its immediate invaders, other armies followed and were
only slowly forced northwards by the genius and persistency
of Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">João VI.</div>

<p>Wellington himself was not unpopular in Portugal, but with
Beresford, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the
Portuguese army under the regency which governed Portugal
during the King’s absence in Brazil, it was otherwise. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
punctual discipline was hated, and a growing number of
Portuguese, filled with the ideas of the French Revolution,
nourished a hope of freeing their country from
what they considered the undue interference
of the foreigner, and the dominion of
what appeared to be obsolete and reactionary methods. In
1817 a plot of General Gomes Freire de Andrade against
Beresford proclaimed to all the world how necessary discipline
was for Portugal. The plot was discovered, and Gomes
Freire was executed. But three years later a revolution broke
out. Beresford, who had been absent in Brazil, was refused
a landing on his return, the Regency was overthrown, and
a new Constitution drawn up. King João VI returned in the
following year from Brazil. In 1822 Brazil pronounced itself
independent and chose the King’s popular and liberal-minded
son, Pedro, to be its ruler. King João was disposed to accept
some kind of constitution, and entrusted the Conde de Palmella
with the drawing up of a constitution less radical than that
of 1820. He had, however, counted without the Queen
Carlotta and his son, Dom Miguel. They succeeded in overthrowing
the constitutional party, and King João VI was
obliged to take refuge from his own son on an English man-of-war
in 1823. In the following year, with the help of the
Powers, he succeeded in restoring his authority, and Dom
Miguel was banished. King João died two years later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maria II da Gloria.</div>

<p>His eldest son, Pedro, as Emperor of Brazil, renounced
the throne of Portugal in favour of his daughter, Maria II
da Gloria, then a small child. In the hope
of healing the strife which bade fair to be the
irremediable ruin of Portugal, he decided that
his brother Miguel should act as Regent and marry his niece,
under condition of swearing to accept the Constitution. Dom
Miguel came to Portugal—<i>o rei chegou, o rei chegou</i>—and
under cover of accepting the Constitution had himself proclaimed
King (in June, 1828), while his niece and betrothed
wife was being educated in Paris. A vigorous persecution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
of Liberals and Constitutionalists followed. Thousands of
them left the country as exiles, others suffered cruel torments
in prison, and others were executed: and more seeds of that
mutual hatred and vindictiveness were sown between Portuguese
and Portuguese which a century was unable to root out.
Pedro returned from Brazil to fight for his daughter’s throne,
and reached the Azores in the spring of 1832. Two years
later Miguel, who in spite of all his faults possessed many good
qualities, and was beloved by the Portuguese people, was
finally defeated at Thomar and by the treaty of Evora renounced
the throne. King Pedro himself died in the same
year. In 1836 Queen Maria was married to Prince Ferdinand
of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Her reign was embittered by
military <i>pronunciamentos</i> in favour of a more radical or more
moderate constitution, and, in 1852, a year before the Queen’s
death, the Duke of Saldanha succeeded in imposing a constitution
which remained in force for some years. He himself
continued to be the make-weight in Portuguese politics until
1871, when after a brief term of office he was overthrown in
turn by the Conservatives and sent as Ambassador to London,
where he died in 1876.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pedro V.</div>

<p>After Queen Maria’s death, the enlightened and art-loving
King Consort Ferdinand ruled on behalf of his son, Pedro V,
until he was pronounced to be of age in 1855.
The new King died in 1861, and was succeeded
by Luiz I (1861-89), during whose reign the
unpatriotic strife between Liberal and Conservative politicians,
<i>Progressistas</i> and <i>Regeneradores</i>, went on unabated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luiz I.</div>

<p>It is not pleasant to dwell on the fate of a
country, once as glorious as any in Europe,
now torn and harassed by party feuds,
personal ambitions, false ideas of liberty, artificial and purely
formal conceptions of Constitutionalism, misgovernment
and corruption, neglect, indifference, despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carlos I.</div>

<p>Luiz I was succeeded in 1889 by his son, Carlos I, whose
reign began as it ended, disastrously for Portugal. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
very year of his accession, the house of Braganza was
driven from Brazil, which declared itself a Republic. In the
following year a colonial question between
Great Britain and Portugal led to the presentation
of an ultimatum by Great Britain,
and what was ignorantly regarded as the King’s weakness
inspired an abortive republican rising at Oporto in 1891.
In the following year Portugal’s credit was laid in the dust by
a formal declaration of bankruptcy. The events of these
four years were sufficient to disgust anyone with the business
of king. The King, under the Constitution, had really little
power to interfere. The Queen, Marie Amélie, daughter of
the Comte de Paris, was looked upon askance as a friend
of the religious orders, and her courage and charity awakened
no response of chivalry in the hearts of the Portuguese. The
position came to be this: that every kind of support was
refused to the Monarchy, which was then bitterly criticised
and attacked by those who, had they supported it loyally,
might have made it a success. It was “a Monarchy without
any monarchists,” said King Carlos.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Theophilo Braga, and Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos.</div>

<p>The Portuguese have reason to be proud of their literature,
which, though it does not abound in masterpieces of the first
order, possesses a very large number of works,
in verse and prose, of conspicuous merit and
deserving to be far better known, both in
Portugal and abroad. The Portuguese have
aroused themselves from their indifference in
this respect. Dr. Theophilo Braga has produced
an immense work of discovery and criticism. Dona
Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos, a far more scholarly critic,
has, during the last forty years, carried through a work no less
immense and far more valuable and abiding. Her genius
is like an electric torch shedding powerful light as it rests in
turn on each of the great Portuguese writers, and illuminating
by the way all the nooks and crannies. The difference between
these, the two great authorities on Portuguese literature, is
that the works of the former satisfy no one but himself, those
of the latter everyone but herself. And there are many
younger workers now in the same field eager to discover,
decipher, print and re-edit the old monuments of Portuguese
literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lost Treasures.</div>

<p>In the past the carelessness has been such that several
famous works which were in all probability originally Portuguese,
have been allowed to perish utterly or
to survive only in Spanish translations.
<i>Amadis of Gaul</i> is probably one of these, and
another masterpiece claimed wrongly by Spain is <i>Palmeirim
of England</i>, by Francisco de Moraes Cabral, in the first half of
the sixteenth century, and held by Cervantes worthy to be preserved
as carefully as the poems of Homer. In the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
century Garcia de Resende regretted the loss of many poems,
and Damião de Goes lamented the number of valuable manuscripts
that had perished because they had not been placed in
the <i>Torre do Tombo</i>. Even as recently as the nineteenth
century (in the eighteenth the earthquake and the fire that
followed it swallowed up hundreds of precious books and
manuscripts), the archives of the family of Niza were sold by
a servant of the family as waste-paper, like the original manuscripts
of the Polyglot Bible of Alcalá some thirty years earlier.
The Niza papers had been placed for safety in a cellar during
the Peninsular War, and were sold by the kilo. (The first
Marquis of Niza was the great-great-grandson of Vasco da
Gama. The last Marquis was the grandfather of Dona
Constança Telles da Gama, whose imprisonment for eight
months under the Republic caused so great a sensation.)
But although by this and similar mischances a vast number
of invaluable documents have been lost, a large store remains,
and a considerable number have been published of late years,
the Lisbon Academy of Sciences doing excellent work in this
respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earliest Poetry.</div>

<p>It was in verse that the Portuguese first distinguished themselves.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries they
attained such proficiency in imitations of
Provençal song that it became the fashion for
lyrics throughout Spain to be composed in
Galician or Portuguese, and a large collection of lyrics in praise
of the Virgin was compiled and in part written by King
Alfonso X of Castille in the Galician tongue.</p>

<p>The first Portuguese poem was probably not prior to the
beginning of the thirteenth century, or prior by a very few
years only, but unwritten songs of the people had been
composed, especially by the women, probably without a break
since the days of Rome. The Portuguese Court poets of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were not cut off from the
life of the people. How simple were the Courts of those days
may be realised from the rules drawn up for the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
children by Alfonso the Learned, whose daughter Isabel was
mother of King Diniz of Portugal. The King’s sons must
wash their hands before and after meals, and not wipe them
on their clothes. They must not sing at meals lest they seem
to be merry with wine, nor bend over the dish as if they wanted
all the food. And thus among the more servile imitations of
Provençal poetry crept in the Court versions of the <i>Cantares
de amigo</i>, sung by the people in Galicia and Portugal, which
still delight by their freshness and savour of the soil. With
the death of King Diniz (1325), of whose own poems over a
hundred survive, the Provençal Portuguese school of poetry
ended. If Spain borrowed from Portugal in the composition
of the early lyrics, she repaid the debt later with the <i>romances</i>,
those lovely fifteenth and sixteenth century crystallisations
of the longer early heroic poems and chronicles of Spain. So
few <i>romances</i> originally belonged to Portugal that Spanish
came to be regarded as the appropriate language for them,
and a Portuguese poet composing a <i>romance</i> would do so in
Castilian as in the thirteenth century a Spanish poet would
compose his lyrics in Portuguese. Gil Vicente wrote his
ballad of Duardos and Flérida in Spanish, and it was only
three centuries later that it was translated into Portuguese,
probably by Almeida Garrett. It was the Breton cycle which
in its vague romance especially appealed to Portuguese taste,
and its episodes have been, with the death of Inés de Castro,
the prominent theme in Portuguese literature. In history,
too, in the fourteenth century, Nun’ Alvares took Sir Galahad
for ideal, and in the sixteenth King Sebastian became a
Portuguese King Arthur, his return long looked for in Portugal.
There is a gap in Portuguese literature in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, similar to that in the seventeenth and
eighteenth, so far as poetry is concerned, and the sixteenth,
during which Portuguese poetry revived and reached its
highest expression, began with dull and uninspired Court
poems—of a Court now more artificial than that of King
Diniz—such as the majority of those in Garcia de Resende’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
<i>Cancioneiro</i>, containing poems of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, and published in 1516.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Prose.</div>

<p>In prose, however, the fifteenth century was remarkable.
Portuguese prose began with brief jejune chronicles, and with
<i>nobiliarios</i> or <i>livros de linhagens</i> (thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries). A famous <i>Livro
de linhagens</i>, or book of descents, was that
compiled by Pedro, son of King Diniz, in prose which already
possesses considerable literary pretensions, although it cannot
compare for clearness, grace, and concision with the admirable
work of King Duarte, <i>O Leal Conselheiro</i> (<i>circa</i> 1430).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronicles.</div>

<p>To the fifteenth century also belong the first important
chronicles. Fernão Lopes, who died in the middle of the
century, and wrote chronicles which have been
set side by side with or even above those of
Froissart, was Keeper of the Royal Archives,
and <i>Chronista môr</i>. As such he was charged to “set forth in
chronicles the histories of the kings—<i>poer em coronycas as
estorias dos reis</i>.” He wrote that of King João I, and probably
that of all the other Kings of Portugal to his own day. Lopes is
described as “a notable person” by his successor, Gomes
Eannes de Azurara, who died in 1474, and who completed the
chronicle of João I, and wrote among other works the <i>Chronica
do descobrimento e conquista da Guiné</i> (published at Paris, 1841;
translated into English, with an important study, by Mr.
Edgar Prestage). Ruy de Pina became <i>Chronista môr</i> in
1497, and wrote or re-wrote the chronicles of the Kings of
Portugal from Sancho I to João II in a somewhat more
affected and artificial style than that of his predecessors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Damião de Goes.</div>

<p>The sixteenth century, famous for its poets in Portugal as
in other countries, was also exceedingly rich in Portuguese
prose of the most varied kinds. Damião de
Goes (1502-74) took up the work of the early
chronicles, and wrote during the years 1557-66
his famous <i>Chronica de Dom Manoel</i>, a clear and careful
account of the discovery and conquest of India and of events<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
at home. Damião de Goes’ life and character are even more
interesting than his works, and although his travels did not
extend beyond Europe they were as arresting in their way
as are the <i>Peregrinações</i> of Fernão Mendes Pinto (1509-80)
in theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fernão Mendes Pinto.</div>

<p>During twenty-one years the life of the latter was a series
of “great hardships and misfortunes and dangers.” He was
thirteen times taken captive, and twenty-one
times (in another passage he says sixteen
times) sold as a slave during his adventurous
career in the East, and he has left us the most vivid and
delightful memoirs. They read like a modern novel, but,
except for some obvious mistakes in facts and figures, bear
the stamp of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">History.</div>

<p>The glorious enterprises and discoveries of King Manoel’s
reign naturally found many chroniclers. Fernão Lopes
de Castanheda spent more than twenty years
over his “History of the Discovery and
Conquest of India by the Portuguese” (1554),
scrupulously visiting the places and many of the persons
concerned. The knowledge thus acquired was all the wealth
he brought back with him from India, and he was reduced
to accept the office of beadle of the Faculty of Arts at Coimbra
University. The style of his history is plain and unadorned,
sentence after sentence beginning with “And”; the narrative
is simple and outspoken, and has an ingenuous freshness
suitable to the account of the “seas ne’er traversed before.”
Some of his pages, as the description of the natives of Malabar,
might have come straight out of Herodotus. João de Barros,
of Vizeu (1496-1570) began the famous <i>Decadas</i>, describing
the Portuguese conquests in the East, and wrote a romance
of chivalry and a Portuguese grammar. His <i>Decadas</i> were
continued by Diogo de Couto (1544-1616), who was able to
bring to their composition the knowledge from fifty years of
personal experience in India. Gaspar Correa, born in 1495,
wrote the <i>Lendas da India</i>, and was killed in a quarrel, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
perhaps deliberately murdered at Malaca in 1564. Bras
d’Albuquerque (1500-1580) composed the <i>Commentarios</i> of
his father, the great Affonso d’Albuquerque, from original
letters written by the latter in India to King Manoel, a
straightforward account marked by much restraint and regard
for truth, and enlivened by vivid scenes here and there.
Many of those who went to India, missionaries, adventurers,
soldiers, officials, wrote narratives of their experiences. The
<i>Roteiros</i> of Vasco da Gama and João de Castro are of remarkable
interest both for their contents and their style. There
are few more stirring and pathetic narratives than those of the
tragedies of the sea, the <i>Historia Tragico-Maritima</i> (Lisbon,
2 vols., 1735-6), tales of shipwreck which made the greatest
impression on those who read and listened to them. One
suspects that Mendes Pinto wrote some of his wonderfully
vivid shipwreck scenes under the recollection of those longer
narratives, to the most famous of which, the Shipwreck of
Sepulveda, he refers in his memoirs. Antonio Tenreiro wrote
an <i>Itinerario</i> of his journey by land from India to Europe,
combining with this an account of other travels. His principal
journey was from Ormuz to Tripoli by camel with a single
Arab (<i>Mouro alarve</i>) attendant, taking twenty-two days to
cross the desert. From Tripoli he proceeded to Cyprus, Crete,
Ferrara, Genoa, thence “with much fear of the Turks,” by
sea to the coast of Valencia, and on to Toledo and Lisbon.
He observes minutely and raps out his information in concise
disconnected sentences. Pantaleão de Aveiro wrote an Itinerary
of the Holy Land, Frei Gaspar Fructuoso the <i>Saudades
da Terra</i>, Frei Gaspar da Cruz a <i>Tratado das Cousas da China
e de Ormuz</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great Prose Works.</div>

<p>Apart from these profane writings, there were several
notable preachers in this century, as the celebrated Archbishop
of Braga, Frei Bartholomeu dos Martyres
(1514-90), Frei Miguel dos Santos (d. 1595),
only one of whose sermons, on the death of
King Sebastian, remains. Of Diogo de Paiva de Andrade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
(1528-75) 181 survive (3 vols., 1603, 4, 15), and there are
three volumes (1611, 3, 6) of those of Frei Francisco Fernandes
Galvão (1554-1610). Heitor Pinto (d. 1584), Professor of
Scripture at Coimbra University, wrote eleven dialogues:
<i>Imagem da vida christã</i> (Coimbra, 2 vols., 1563, 72). The
<i>Trabalhos de Jesus</i> by Frei Thomé de Jesus did not appear
till 1620 and 1629 (Lisbon, 2 pts.). Gonçalo Fernandes
Trancoso is remembered by his <i>Contos e historias de proveito
e exemplo</i>, twenty-nine of which first appeared in 1585. João
de Lucena wrote the life of St. Francis Xavier: <i>Historia da
Vida do Padre Francisco Xavier</i>. Samuel Usque, a Portuguese
Jew of Lisbon, composed a <i>Consolaçam ás tribulações de Israel</i>
(Ferrara, 1552), much needed in that period of massacres of
“new Christians.” It is written in a coloured and exuberant
style, recalling at times that of the Spanish writer Luis de
León. All these works and many more, though unequal in
merit, are worth recording and reading partly from the interest
of the facts and descriptions they contain, and partly because
after them good Portuguese prose only occasionally revisited
the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gil Vicente.</div>

<p>But, of course, the sixteenth century, for all the excellence
of its prose, was also the golden age of Portuguese poetry.
Gil Vicente (about 1470-1540), although he
inaugurated the Portuguese drama in 1502,
was essentially a lyric poet. In his work
the true spirit of old Portugal survives, a spirit of simple
mirth with dance and song, and a note of gaiety so rare in
Portuguese literature. His plays are of extreme value to
students of Portugal in the sixteenth century, the <i>cantigas</i>
and <i>romances</i>, etc., which they contain are for all time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miranda.</div>

<p>Francisco de Sá de Miranda (<i>c.</i> 1490-1558) brought back
from his travels in Italy the fixed resolve to introduce the
Italian metres into Portuguese poetry, and,
retiring some years later from the Court,
devoted the rest of his life to poetry, gardening,
and the chase in the beautiful province of Minho. A man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of austere and noble character, he was less generous to himself
than to his friends, wrote an early biographer. Friends he
had many, among the peasants and shepherds of the Minho
hills, the neighbouring nobles and poets from all parts of
Portugal. He imprinted his individuality on his poems
written in the new style, and especially on his eclogues composed
in the old octosyllabic <i>redondilhas</i>. Among his friends
were Diogo Bernardes, some thirty years his junior, who
celebrated his beloved river Lima, on whose banks was his
birthplace, with a softness and fluency in the new metres not
given to Sá de Miranda, and whose sonnets rivalled those
with which Camões soothed an exile’s grief; Antonio Ferreira
(1528-1569), who was the first to write a classical drama,
<i>Inés de Castro</i>, and who remained faithful to Portuguese when
most of his contemporaries wrote indifferently in Portuguese
or Spanish; Dom Manoel de Portugal (1520-1606), the first
poet to follow Sá de Miranda in adopting the Italian measures;
Pedro de Andrade Caminha (<i>c.</i> 1520-89), highly praised by
his contemporaries, but whose verse has a certain wooden
quality foreign to theirs. To name all the poets whose verse
was inspired by the genius of those spacious times were an
endless task. Frei Agostinho da Cruz (<i>c.</i> 1540-1619) wrote
verses, like his brother Diogo Bernardes—</p>

<p class="noindent">Of Francisco de Sá de Meneses, Conde de Mattosinhos (he
was created Count of Mattosinhos in 1580 and died there in
1584) much of the poetry has been lost, but what survives is
of high excellence. His delightful verses to the river Leça
were not rediscovered till the nineteenth century, by Dr.
Sousa Viterbo in the Torre do Tombo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bernardim Ribeiro.</div>

<p>About the lives of the two poets of <i>Saudade</i>, Bernardim
Ribeiro and Christovam Falcão, little is known, but their
eclogues are notable for their perfection of
form and that passionate melancholy peculiar
to Portuguese literature. Elaborate efforts
have been made to construct their biographies out of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
poems, a risky proceeding with poets who so evidently
delighted in dismal incidents for their own sake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camões.</div>

<p>Luis de Camões, the greatest of all these poets, was a few
years younger than most of them. To him at least grief and
disappointment came in flowing measure, and
he lived to die with his country in 1580,
probably at the age of 56. Out of his sorrows
he built a fairy edifice of verse, which has delighted and
sustained his countrymen ever since. With him Portuguese
poetry reached a level only dimly heralded by his predecessors:
to judge from their poetry only, it would be difficult to believe
that the lives of Vicente, Miranda and Camões overlapped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dom Francisco Manuel.</div>

<p>The most notable literary figure of the seventeenth century
in Portugal is Dom Francisco Manuel de Mello (1608-66).
Those who read of his manifold adventures
in Mr. Prestage’s biography will perhaps
wonder that he should have found time or
temper to write at all, and his works are many and various,
from the “History of the War in Catalonia” to the <i>Carta de
Guia de Casados</i> and <i>Cartas Familiares</i>, admirably clear and
direct in style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seventeenth-Century Prose.</div>

<p>Most of his contemporaries were infected with <i>gongorismo</i>
from Spain, and their writings defaced by conceits and
hyperbole. Jacyntho Freire d’Andrade
(1597-1657) wrote the biography of Dom João
de Castro in an artificial style closely modelled
on that of Tacitus. Frei Bernardo de Brito
(1569-1617) composed <i>A Monarchia Lusitana</i> (parts 1 and 2),
of which it has been said that it ends where it should have
begun—with the history of Portugal,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but which was written
in good Portuguese prose. Frei Luis de Sousa (1555-1632)
wrote among other works the life of Bartholomeu dos Martyres,
Archbishop of Braga. As Manoel de Sousa Coutinho, he
returned from the disastrous Alcacer Kebir expedition after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
a year’s captivity, and married the widow of Dom João
de Portugal, who was killed at Alcacer Kebir. He retired
to a convent, as did also his wife, after their daughter’s death.
The legend of the return of Dona Magdalena’s first husband
inspired Garrett with his celebrated play, <i>Frei Luis de Sousa</i>.
There were a considerable number of miscellaneous prose
works of merit, as the <i>Discursos varios</i> of Manoel Severim
de Faria (1583-1655) and the <i>Itinerario da India por terra até
a ilha de Chipre</i> by Frei Gaspar de S. Bernardino. The works
of the Jesuit Antonio Vieira (1608-1697) fill twenty-six
volumes (with 200 sermons, 500 letters), those of Manoel
Bernardes (1644-1710) nineteen volumes (sermons and moral
treatises). In both Portuguese prose is seen at its best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Love Letters.</div>

<p>In 1669 appeared in French five love letters purporting to
be written by Marianna de Alcoforado, a Portuguese nun born
in 1640, from her convent to a French officer,
afterwards the Marquis de Chamilly. They
were translated, or retranslated into Portuguese
and are reckoned among the masterpieces of Portuguese
prose. Portugal was known for its sentimental fervour, and
the wholly untenable suspicion arises that a French writer
may have composed these letters (basing them on a foundation
of fact), and attributed them to the Portuguese nun as later
Elizabeth Barrett Browning called her love sonnets “Sonnets
from the Portuguese.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Eighteenth Century.</div>

<p>In the eighteenth century, when lyrical poetry seemed to
have died out of Europe, it became more than ever evident
how much the excellence of Portuguese
literature depends on the lyric. None of the
Portuguese poets of this any more than of the
preceding century attained prominence, while in the eighteenth
there was no compensating excellence in prose. Some letters
and sermons and treatises on the Portuguese language there
were, and Barbosa Machado (1682-1772) composed his
valuable <i>Bibliotheca Lusitana</i>. It was the age of academies
and <i>arcadias</i>. The <i>Academia Real da Historia</i> was founded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
in 1720, the <i>Academia Real das Sciencias</i>, which has done
and continues to do such good service to Portuguese literature,
first met in 1780.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eighteenth-Century Poets.</div>

<p>Of the poets, many of whom met with a tragic fate, José
Agostinho de Macedo (1761-1831) was a dull and copious versifier,
who apparently reserved all his fire for
attacks upon dead or contemporary writers.
He made bold to supersede the <i>Lusiads</i> with
his poem <i>Gama</i> (1811), subsequently revised
and entitled <i>Oriente</i> (1814). Corrêa Garção (1724-72) was imprisoned
by order of the powerful Minister, the Marquez de
Pombal, in 1772, and is stated to have died in prison on the
very day on which his release was ordered. His complete works
were published at Rome in 1888. Domingos dos Reis Quita
(1728-70), a Lisbon hairdresser, wrote odes, idyls, tragedies, a
pastoral drama, but his poetry is second-rate except when
it closely imitates Camões. Antonio José da Silva was born
in Brazil in 1705. He belonged to a family of “new
Christians,” and by the people of Lisbon, which enjoyed his
comedies, he was known as “the Jew.” He perished, strangled
and then burnt, in the <i>auto da fé</i> of 18th October, 1739.
Francisco Manuel do Nascimento (Filinto Elysio), more
fortunate, escaped from the Inquisition and lived and died in
Paris. He earned a living by translation, and his copious
poetry had a great vogue in his day but now has few readers.
The most talented of all the Portuguese eighteenth-century
poets was another Arcadian, Manuel Maria Barbosa de
Bocage,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> whose Arcadian name was Elmano Sadino. Born
at Setubal in 1765, he deserted from military service in India,
and returned to Lisbon in 1790, where he led a dissipated life
and was in 1797 imprisoned during three months in the
<i>Limoeiro</i> for having published a poem entitled <i>A pavorosa
illusão da Eternidade</i>. After the <i>Limoeiro</i> he was a prisoner
of the Inquisition for four months, and was then relegated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to a monastery. He died, worn out by his own excesses, at
the age of 40, in 1805. With a fund of satire and gift of
facile improvisation, he rose occasionally to real poetry, as in
some of his sonnets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Romantics.</div>

<p>In the nineteenth century lyric poetry revived in Portugal
as elsewhere, although the influence of Byron did not there
inspire any genius such as Espronceda in
Spain. The romanticism of Antonio Feliciano
de Castilho (1800-75) was of a gentler kind.
Blind from the age of six, his literary activity was nevertheless
untiring. Besides writing a large number of books of verse,
he translated Ovid, Anacreon, Virgil, Molière, Shakespeare,
Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>. Other romantic poets were Soares de Passos
(1826-60); João de Lemos (1819-89), who in <i>A Lua de
Londres</i> regrets Portugal and his native Douro; Mendes Leal
(1818-86), who won a great reputation with his heroic odes
(especially <i>Ave Cesar</i>, <i>O Pavilhão</i>, and <i>Napoleão no Kremlin</i>);
José Simões Dias (1844-99), who, besides his poems (<i>Peninsulares</i>),
wrote a history of Portuguese literature, and Gomes
d’Amorim (1827-92).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reaction.</div>

<p>In 1865 appeared the <i>Poema da Mocidade</i>, by Pinheiro
Chagas, with a letter by Castilho, which gave rise to Quental’s
<i>Bom senso e bom gosto</i> and the beginning of a
new school of poets. Foremost among these
were Anthero de Quental (1842-91) himself,
and João de Deus Ramos (1830-96). Their poetry has nothing
in common, but they are both equally far removed from the
traditional romantic school. The sonnets of Anthero (many
of which have been translated into English by Mr. Edgar
Prestage) have nothing to fear from comparison with those
of any other nineteenth-century poet. Portuguese in his
hands became adamantine and sonorous, and the sonnet a
trumpet-call. João de Deus, on the other hand, wrote
feathery light lyrics with great naturalness and charm, and
in his easy flow of improvisation is far the more characteristically
Portuguese of the two. Thomaz Ribeiro (1831-1901)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
belonged to the romantic school, and is the author of the
celebrated ode <i>A Portugal</i>. Gonçalves Crespo (1846-83)
published only two small volumes of poems, <i>Miniaturas</i> (1870)
and <i>Nocturnos</i> (1882), which contain one or two little
masterpieces, such as the sonnet <i>Mater dolorosa</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Living Poets.</div>

<p>Of living poets the most widely known is Senhor Abilio
Guerra Junqueiro (born in 1850), who now, however, rarely
publishes any verse. He is a true poet, and
<i>Finis Patriae</i>, and, above all, <i>Os Simples</i>
(1892, sixth edition, 1913), contain the best
poems in the Portuguese language of the last twenty years.
In other works his poetry has often suffered from an invasion
of rhetoric, but it always displays vigour and courageous
patriotism. There are many schools, the Cloud Treaders
(<i>Nephelibatas</i>), of whom Snr. Eugenio de Castro is the head;
the Parnassians, as Colonel Christovam Ayres, Snr. Antonio
Feijó, João Diniz, Joaquim de Araujo, aiming at and sometimes
achieving that perfection of form which marked the
work of Gonçalves Crespo, João Penha, Antonio Nobre; the
pantheistic school of the <i>Renascença</i>, of which the principal
poets are Snr. Teixeira de Pascoaes, and Snr. Mario Beirão.
Two notable living poets are Snr. Affonso Lopes Vieira and
Snr. Antonio Correa d’Oliveira, whose works are always read
with eagerness, the latter especially having caught some
of the sixteenth-century lyrical vein. The living poets of
Portugal are, however, so numerous that it is impossible even
to give the names of all of them. A French critic, who names
some sixty, says modestly: “On ne peut tout citer.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Almeida Garrett.</div>

<p>It is preferable to leave them on one side (although an
anthology of some merit might easily be formed
from their works) and to go back to that
strange figure and very real poet of the first half
of the nineteenth century, the Visconde de Almeida Garrett
(1799-1854). He was master of a peculiar and fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
style of Portuguese prose, he revived the Portuguese drama,
he wrote long romantic poems and exquisitely finished short
lyrics, and he collected old Portuguese romances, which,
however, he could not refrain from retouching and adorning.
It is impossible to over-estimate his services to Portuguese
literature, although the works written by him that will be read a
hundred years hence will probably fit into a very small volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Herculano.</div>

<p>In prose the other great figure of the nineteenth century in
Portugal was Alexandre Herculano (1810-77), historian,
poet and historical novelist (<i>Historia de
Portugal</i>; <i>Lendas e Narrativas</i>; <i>Eurico</i>, <i>etc</i>).
His works are of permanent value, and his
prose bears the impress of his strong exceptional character.
Other historical writers were Pinheiro Chagas (1842-95),
Latino Coelho (1825-91), Rebello da Silva (1821-72), and
Oliveira Martins (1845-94).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oliveira Martins.</div>

<p>The latter’s first work was a historical novel, and his
work remained romantic throughout, but he had the power
of reconstituting historical scenes in their
picturesqueness and colour, and making the
dry bones live. His most celebrated works
are his <i>Historia de Portugal</i>, <i>Portugal Contemporaneo</i>, <i>A Vida
de Nun’ Alvares</i>, and the <i>Filhos de João I</i>. He did not,
however, confine himself in his historical writings to Portugal,
but embraced the histories of Greece, Rome, and Iberian
civilisation. When one remembers that he was also an active
politician and Minister of Finance in 1892, it is not surprising
that he had worn himself out before reaching the age of 50.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camillo.</div>

<p>The novel in Portugal since the middle of the nineteenth
century has embraced the most varied kinds and sometimes
attained a high degree of merit. Camillo
Castello Branco (1826-1890), most Portuguese
of writers in theme and style, wrote over a
hundred novels. He was gifted with a temperament that
could not fail to make his life restless and unhappy and is
reflected in the sentimental tragedies and nervous pessimism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and vitriolic satire of his books. By his countrymen his
novels, especially <i>Amor de perdição</i>, are still read with enthusiasm;
for foreigners they are redeemed by the pure Portuguese
of their style and by the occasional insight to be won
from them into the Portuguese life of the second half of the
nineteenth century. But probably it is necessary to be born
a Portuguese in order to do them full justice. For those
who wish to learn Portuguese untainted with Gallicisms they
are invaluable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eça de Queiroz.</div>

<p>Eça de Queiroz (1846-1900), the other great Portuguese
novelist of the century, is, on the contrary, almost as much
French as Portuguese in style, and is probably
the best known of modern Portuguese writers
outside Portugal. His work contains many
arresting pages, especially those which describe country or
provincial life in Portugal (in <i>O Crime do Padre Amaro</i>, 1875;
<i>A Correspondencia de Fradique Mendes</i>, 1891; <i>A Illustre Casa
de Ramires</i>, 1897; <i>A Cidade e as Serras</i>, 1901). Life in Lisbon
is described, or perhaps one should say distorted, caricatured
in <i>O Primo Basilio</i> (1878), <i>Os Maias</i> (1880), and in part of
<i>A Reliquia</i> (1887). Eça de Queiroz went from strength to
strength, or rather from weakness to strength. His later
work is more original and above all more Portuguese. It is
in parts very striking indeed, and through all his novels runs
that peculiar flavour of irony and sarcasm which prevents
him from ever being merged entirely in the French realistic
or naturalistic school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julio Diniz.</div>

<p>A writer of less vigorous talent was “Julio Diniz” (Joaquim
Guilherme Gomes Coelho) (1839-71), whose novels, <i>Uma
Familia Inglesa</i> (1862), <i>As Pupillas do
Sr. Reitor</i> (1867), <i>A Morgadinha dos Cannaviaes</i>
(1868), <i>Os Fidalgos da Casa Morisca</i>
(1871) treat of country themes with a quiet charm and no
little psychological interest. Some of his pages recall those
of the Spanish novelist Fernán Caballero in their delicate
observation and gentle optimism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Living Novelists.</div>

<p>Of living novelists, Snr. Teixeira de Queiroz (born in 1848)
also occasionally recalls Fernán Caballero in a certain naïve
and delightful power of description, preferably
of country scenes and peasants. His best
work is contained in the short stories of his
<i>Comedia do Campo</i>—<i>Contos</i>, <i>Amor Divino</i>, <i>Antonio Fogueira</i>,
<i>Novos Contos</i>, <i>Amores, Amores</i>, <i>A Nossa Gente</i>, <i>A Cantadeira</i>
(1913). Sr. Luiz de Magalhães, born in 1859, who was
Minister of Foreign Affairs in Senhor João Franco’s Ministry,
wrote in 1886 a novel entitled <i>O Brazileiro Soares</i>, a careful
study of a “Brazilian” (that is, a Portuguese returning
enriched from Brazil), which placed him in the front rank of
contemporary Portuguese novelists. Senhor Magalhães Lima,
born in 1857, did not publish his first novel, <i>O Transviado</i>, till
1899. Other novels by the same author are <i>A Paz do Senhor</i>
(1903) and <i>O Reino da Saudade</i> (1904). Senhor Abel Botelho,
born in 1854, and appointed Minister at Buenos Aires by the
Republic, has a great reputation as a novelist. His novels
are professedly “pathological.” A Portuguese critic remarks
that his books sometimes “cause more moral indignation than
aesthetic enjoyment.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Younger contemporary novelists, as
contemporary poets, are very numerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Conto.”</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dona Maria Amalia Vaz de Carvalho.</div>

<p>The short story, or <i>conto</i>, has been written with success by
so many authors that it has almost become a special feature of
modern Portuguese literature: Eça de Queiroz,
Snr. Teixeira de Queiroz, Affonso Botelho,
Fialho d’Almeida (1857-1911)—stories of
Alemtejo in <i>O Paiz das Uvas</i> and other works—the Conde de
Ficalho, the Conde de Sabugosa, Julio Cesar Machado, the
Visconde de Villa Moura (<i>Os Humildes</i>, <i>Bohemios</i>, etc.), and
above all, Trindade Coelho, whose <i>Os Meus Amores</i> are stories
deliberately ingenuous, remarkable for their style. Dona
Maria Amalia Vaz de Carvalho, whose husband was the poet
Gonçalves Crespo, has also written <i>contos</i> and poems. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
her chief work consists in historical studies and in critical
essays. Her works comprise over twenty volumes, and
especially she has won English gratitude
by introducing some part of modern
English literature to Portuguese and Brazilian
readers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Drama.</div>

<p>“<i>Em Portugal nunca chegou a haver theatro</i>—a Portuguese
drama has never existed,” said Garrett (life to a Portuguese is
perhaps not dull enough to drive him to the
theatre), and his own plays for long continued
to be an isolated achievement. Recently, however,
a number of playwrights by no means to be despised have
arisen in Portugal. Foremost among them are Snr. Julio Dantas,
Dom João da Camara (1852-1912), Antonio Ennes (1848-1901),
Snr. Marcellino de Mesquita, Snr. Henrique Lopes de Mendonça
and Snr. Abel Botelho, the novelist. It would almost seem
as if there were two writers to every reader in Portugal.
“Every passing season inundates the bookshops with a flood
of <i>brochures</i> in verse and prose, the proof of an exaggerated
output of books. It seems as if even the illiterates must be
authors” (<i>Diario de Noticias</i>, 6th April, 1914). What
most amazes the foreigner is to see the Lisbon bookshops
parade a crowd of foreign books, while those in Portuguese are
often tucked away in some obscure corner. Modern Portuguese
literature is, unhappily, like finance and politics, largely
of artificial growth, imported from abroad. There is plenty
of writers but no critical reading public.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Critics.</div>

<p>The excessive number of writers is no doubt due in part
to the defects of a criticism which appears not to realise its
power of regulating this stream of production.
A little sincere condemnation may serve to
prevent a whole series of inferior works of
fiction or poetry, especially as Portuguese writers are very
sensitive to criticism. Fortunately contemporary Portuguese
literature now has a promising young critic in Senhor Fidelino
de Figueiredo, who combines sympathy with sincerity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
may do something to check copious, slovenly, and slavishly
imitative writing, and inaugurate a school of concrete criticism.
Senhor Theophile Braga does not deal with contemporary
literature, but is still piling Ossa on Pelion in the wide range
of his works. His long poem, <i>A Visão dos Tempos</i>, was
published in 1864, and his <i>Historia da Litteratura Portugueza</i>
continues to receive valuable additions from time to time.
There is plenty of literary talent in Portugal, but it needs
direction: it would be a thousand pities were it all to be
frittered away from an inability to select and concentrate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Art.</div>

<p>In art the Portuguese have never occupied a very high position.
Perhaps they are too vague and romantic. Yet in
early times they would seem to have excelled
rather in realistic representation on a small
scale than in large romantic pictures, as may
be seen in the admirable, minute sculpture on the tombs at
Alcobaça and in the illustrations of old manuscripts—for
instance, the wonderfully life-like portrait of Prince Henry
the Navigator in the Chronicle of Gomes Eannes de Azurara,
a masterpiece attributed to Nuno Gonçalves, who painted the
exceedingly fine triptychs now in the Lisbon Museum. What
treasures of art are or were (being now transferred to museums)
contained in Portugal’s churches and convents is amply shown
by an excellent magazine of art now being published by Snr.
Joaquim de Vasconcellos, whose researches in connection with
Damião de Goes, Francisco de Hollanda, and other Portuguese
classics have earned him the gratitude of all who interest
themselves in Portuguese literature. This <i>Arte Religiosa de
Portugal</i>, begun in 1914, is published monthly, each part
containing eight beautifully reproduced plates, and costing
500 <i>réis</i> (about two shillings). No one who cares for art will
regret subscribing for it, and certainly after seeing these plates
they will never think of Portugal as a country without art.
Nor is talent lacking in painting and in sculpture at the
present day in Portugal. Witness the painters Sr. Bordallo
Pinheiro, Sr. Carlos Reis, Sr. José Malhoa and others, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
sculptors, Sr. Soares dos Reis and Sr. Teixeira Lopes, whose
Eça de Queiroz statue and other works have won him universal
admiration. In art, as in literature, caricature usually
flourishes in Portugal, and it is perhaps a useful corrective
of the tendency to copiousness and vagueness of outline, and,
in the hands of clever draughtsmen, has given ample proof
that it need not degenerate into vulgarity. The fervent
activity in many fields gives good hope, at any rate, of a
twentieth-century crop of writers and artists who may
maintain or surpass the achievement of the nineteenth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Language.</div>

<p>The restoration of the Portuguese language to its original
purity is an essential condition, since it is vain to hope to
gather figs from thistles. The late Gonçalves
Vianna, Julio Moreira, and others watched
over Portuguese with loving care, and it is
now under the protection of the celebrated philologist and
folk-lorist, Dr. José Leite de Vasconcellos. But all may do
their share by forswearing and rooting out Gallicisms to the
best of their knowledge (Snr. Candido de Figueiredo does
excellent service here), and when the ground has been cleared
of these noxious weeds—Gallicisms, abstractions, trailing
circumlocutions—Portuguese literature is likely to thrive as
it has not thriven for the last three hundred years.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese Drama.</div>

<p>Portuguese writers have never shown a marked genius for
dramatic action in their works, and although several hundreds
of <i>autos</i> were written in the sixteenth century,
and Antonio Ferreira (1528-69) introduced
the classical drama into Portugal, yet drama
might almost be said not to exist in Portugal were it not
for two great writers: Gil Vicente, of the sixteenth
century, and Almeida Garrett, of the nineteenth. Living
Portuguese writers include some dramatic authors of remarkable
merit, and the theatre has its devoted followers in Lisbon.
But the opera and the cinematograph are the great favourites,
and plays often owe their success to the scenic effects rather
than to the drama in itself. Gil Vicente’s plays in the sixteenth
century were, we know, accompanied by lavish scenic
display, but their dialogue is so spirited, life-like and natural
that they scarcely require alien adornments. Several of these
plays have been recently revived, adapted or translated
(from Spanish to Portuguese) by the poet Snr. Affonso Lopes
Vieira, and favourably received at Lisbon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frei Luiz de Sousa.</div>

<p>As, together with the totally different plays of Garrett,
with the principal of which, <i>Frei Luiz de Sousa</i>, English readers
are familiar in the translation by Mr. Edgar
Prestage (Elkin Mathews, 1909), these plays
of Gil Vicente, lyric poet, satirist, goldsmith,
playwright and actor, form the chief dramatic baggage of the
Portuguese, it will not be amiss to give a few extracts from
them. But, of course, to be fully appreciated, they must be
read whole, and a forthcoming critical edition will make this
less difficult for the ordinary reader than it has hitherto been.</p>

<p>Of the scenes which follow only the English version is here
given—</p>

<h3><i>PEASANTS GOING TO THE FAIR</i></h3>

<p><i>Amancio Vaz.</i> Are you going to the fair, <i>compadre</i>?</p>

<p><i>Deniz Lourenço.</i> To the fair, <i>compadre</i>.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So. Let us go together, you and me, along this stream.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Let us go, in sooth.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I am very glad to find you here.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Are you going to see some one or do you mean to buy?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I will tell you, and we will talk as we go, and have a look at
the village girls. <i>Compadre</i>, my wife has a very difficult
temper, and now, God willing, I am thinking of selling
her, and will give her for next to nothing.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Your wife is good enough, I don’t know what is the matter
with, you, my friend.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If she had married you, you would complain just as I do now.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> Well, as to mine, <i>compadre</i>, she is so slack and clumsy that
she can never knead bread without knocking over the
flour....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>(<i>Later enter Branca Annes, wife of A., and Marta Dias,
wife of D.</i>)</p>

<p><i>B.A.</i> Since in so ill an hour I married, cousin, and such a
husband, I will buy a tub here and keep him under it, and
a great stone on top. For he goes to the fig-trees and
eats ripe and unripe, and all my hung grapes he devours
till he seems a very rubbish heap. He goes for the plums
before they are ripe, he breaks down the cherry trees, and
as to the grapes of the vines I don’t know what he does
with them. He eats all day, sleeps all night, never does
anything, and is always telling me that he is hungry.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> To me he seems a good husband.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE</i></h3>

<p><i>Joanne.</i> Have you seen my brown smock? When you do you
will lose your wits, it looks so well, so well. What in
the world is this, you will say.</p>

<p><i>Catalina.</i> O, what a simpleton! Do not open your mouth if
anyone is at hand.</p>

<p><i>J.</i> O, to the devil with such a life as mine! Catalina, if I take
it into my head, I will go as soon as anything. Is not
there India? What good am I doing here? Better to go.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And what is that to me? There comes Fernando. Good-day,
Fernando. I waited for you at the pass.</p>

<p><i>Fernando.</i> Is Madanella here?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And why are you looking for her? Have you taken a
dislike to me?</p>

<p><i>J.</i> Really, Catalina?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> No more, consider that you have left me.</p>

<p><i>J.</i> Really, Catalina?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> You don’t say where Madanella is gone.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Why do you ask for her?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Because so fortune wills.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> A plague upon you.</p>

<p><i>J.</i> Really, Catalina? Well, if I had known this, I wouldn’t
have given you the distaff that I brought from Santarem.<a id="FNanchor_43a" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE DISCONTENTED PEASANT</i></h3>

<p><i>Frei Paço.</i> What are you grumbling at, peasant?</p>

<p><i>Peasant.</i> At God, who clearly has a great spite against me.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> But what do you complain of?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> He drives me to despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> But how?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> He sends rain when I don’t want it, and when I would have
some rain the very stars glow like the sun. Now He
swamps the newly sown fields or parches everything, or
sends a cruel wind or snow to kill the flocks, and little
He cares. And if I would sue Him for damage done by
lightning and thunder, hail and frost, who is to find out
His dwelling and summon Him! He cares for no one,
and will do as He likes. He might do me good and no
one a penny the worse, but not a bit of it. And so I say
He has a grudge against me, and if you doubt it you have
but to look at my year’s harvest.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Do you think, then, God lives with you?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Look you, <i>padre</i>, what I say is, let Him temper the winter’s
rages, and let the corn ripen, but He in his spite without
gaining a farthing by it, sends rain in January and frost
in April, and summer heat in February, mists in the
month of May, and hail in mid-July. I toil till I drop,
and He in whose care I am makes it ever worse for me.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Consider if you duly pay Him what is His.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> I would pay my tithes willingly enough if He in sheer malice
did not damage what is His and mine.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> And do you ever pray to Him to free you from these
troubles?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Much store He sets on my prayers. I pray quite enough.
I don’t know how it is, but everything is done at His good
pleasure. He killed my father and my master, and then
my wife. Ask yourself why He should kill my aunt
with all her charities, and leave the tax-gatherers, who
plague me daily.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> They say there is no better gift than good advice. Do
then as I bid you: conform yourself with the will of God,
and make good sense your mirror.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Let Him conform Himself with me. I am poor as a dog,
and tell Him so daily, and He, it may be, rejoices. Offering
and prayer avail me not a whit: now He gives but straw
without grain, and now neither grain nor straw, but only
infinite oppression. Therefore, I would have this boy of
mine enter the Church, not that he is especially inclined
that way, but that he may live a life of greater ease.
If you, <i>padre</i>, will teach him, all I have will be yours.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Yes, if he is so minded.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> He has intelligence for anything, and a good singing voice.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Here, take this paper, and read those verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p><i>Sebastian.</i> Is this for cummin or must I go for saffron?</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> You know nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> I know where the village shop is.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> He is as sharp as a sword, there isn’t a goat in the herd that
he doesn’t know.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Come now, without more ado, say the A B C D E.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> ’A be seedy.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Say A X.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Aex was a tailor who lived by the Cathedral.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> If your life is spared, Sebastian, you will make a fine scholar.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> It looks as if the plough had been at work among these
letters.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> You need much examining. And now, as to Latin: say
<i>Beatus vir</i>.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> O, that is easy enough: <i>Bi ora tres ratos vir</i> (I saw three
mice).</p>

<p><i>P.</i> See what learning!<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE COURTIER PRIEST</i></h3>

<p><i>Frey Paço enters in cassock and cape, with velvet cap and
gloves and gilt sword, mincing like a very sweet courtier,
and says</i>:</p>

<p>He who sees me enter with such antics will think I am
gone mad till he knows that I am Frey Paço. <i>Glory be
to God</i> and <i>For ever and ever</i> are not for me, but a gilt sword,
since it looks well to wear a sword at court. So refined
am I; and that there should be no doubt of it, I had an
excellent idea: I never let them shave my tonsure. So
do not expect me to address you with <i>Glory to God</i> or
<i>Praised be Jesus Christ</i>, for all my priest’s frock. And
I am so finished a courtier that I may well say that the
psalms I recite are—envy and gossip. My speech is
gentle and courteous with great store of compliments.
Expect no deeds from me but be content with words borne
away by the wind. Favour and disaffection am I, the
protector of lovers; I disillusion those who trust me and
am the very temple of the god of love and the hell of the
love-lorn. But since the law of love is changed, and
everything grows cold, I love now by agreement and sigh
to order.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<h3><i>FREI PAÇO GIVES A LESSON IN COURT MANNERS</i></h3>

<p><i>Frei Paço.</i> My friend, a noble lady must be rich and fair, sensitive,
serene, courteous, gentle, charming.</p>

<p><i>Apariço.</i> Giralda is all that.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Let us see how this head-dress suits her.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Away, away with it, it is not fit for anyone to wear.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> You mean, peasant, that it is not for harvesters but for
the Court.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is a magpie’s tail, and not for a woman to wear; so thinks
Apariço.</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Yet it didn’t suit her ill.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Who ever saw a sparrow with its tail at the back of its head!</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> I’m afraid she will not suit.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Well, she has not the air.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She has been treading grapes in the wine-press and is all
stained, but she will go and have a wash....</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> Drop me a curtsey now. Let us see how she does it.</p>

<p><i>G.</i> This side or that?</p>

<p><i>F.P.</i> See what a manner for the Court! My fine lady keeper
of goats, you must do thus. Did you mark me? And
make the steps so. Do you understand? And you will
look thus, with lofty mien, your body very straight,
laughing little and subtly, with a spice of honest deceit.
To speak only occasionally is excellent. You must not
be in love nor give love over, and to show that you are
fancy-free be careful not to sigh.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h3><i>MOFINA MENDES</i></h3>

<p><i>Payo.</i> Since it is the will of God that I should pay so harmful
a shepherdess, in reward for your trouble, take this pot
of oil and go and sell it at the fair, and perhaps you will
prosper, since I cannot with you in my service.</p>

<p><i>Mofina.</i> Straightway in God’s name to the fair of Trancoso
will I go, and will make much money. With the money
of the oil I will buy ducks’ eggs, which is the cheapest
thing I can get there, and each egg hatched will give
me a duck and every duck a shilling. At a low price they
will yield over a million and a half (<i>réis?</i>). These ducks’
eggs will bring me a rich and honourable marriage, and
on the day of my wedding I will go dressed in a robe of
scarlet, and before me the bridegroom will go courting me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
I will come from within dancing a dance like this and
singing this song.</p>

<p>(<i>So speaks Mofina Mendes with the pot of oil on her head,
and as she gives her mind ever more to the dancing,
it falls off.</i>)<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE POOR GENTLEMAN</i></h3>

<p><i>Ordonho.</i> Who is your master, brother, say?</p>

<p><i>Apariço.</i> O, it is the devil himself. Year in, year out, we are
both dead of hunger and misery.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> Who does he pass the time with?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> What do I know! He goes about like a scalded dog.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> And what is his occupation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That of a fool. Combing his hair and fasting, all day
without food, singing and playing on the guitar, sighing
and yawning. He is ever talking to himself, and the verses
he makes are so cold and insipid and senseless that they
make one pity him. And the airs he gives himself!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
That is what enrages me. I have been in his service
three years and have never seen him with half a crown,
but in our expenditure a shilling lasts a month.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> Mercy on us, what do you eat?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not even of bread do we eat our fill.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> And his horse?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Skin and bones, the bones piercing the skin. I and the
horse and he eat scarcely anything. Yet you should
see him boasting and pretending to be a valiant knight,
and singing his own praises the whole live-long day.
But the other day, in an alley there, they gave him a fine
thrashing. O, such a thrashing!</p>

<p><i>O.</i> What with?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With an old stick.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It gave me such pleasure.</p>

<p><i>O.</i> And he said nothing?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Took it without a word, blow on blow. He comes home
late at night, being shut in the house all day since he dare
not show himself on account of his clothes. And he calls
out gaily, “To supper,” as if he had supper ready. And
I have nothing for him, and he has nothing for me to give
him. And he takes a crust of bread and a shrivelled
turnip and fastens his teeth in it like a dog. I don’t know
how he keeps up his strength.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE MOÇO’S COMPLAINT</i></h3>

<p>Do they call a chest a bed here or is there no meaning
in words! All my nights in his house were nights spent
in an open boat at sea, not to speak of other evils. Senhor
Judge, I have been six years in this gentleman’s service,
and might have been a barber by now but for his false
promises. When I entered his service he was in better
plight, but now, good lack, it is all up with him, and his
guitar, and his horse, and his bed, and his clothes, and
my service, and all the rest. This last night, as I lay ill
at ease on a chest with my feet hanging over, he woke me
up at one o’clock, and: “O, if you knew, Fernando, what
verses I have just made.” He bids me light the lamp and
hold the inkstand for him, and there was his dog howling
and I standing there cursing because in my first sleep my
master must needs make verses.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE NOBLEMAN’S CHAPLAIN</i></h3>

<p><i>Chaplain.</i> <i>Senhor</i>, it seems time....</p>

<p><i>Nobleman.</i> Say on, <i>padre</i>, say on.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I say that it is close on three years that I have been your
chaplain.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Most true. Say on.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And I might have been the Prince’s or even the King’s.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> In good sooth, I don’t know about that, <i>padre</i>.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Yes, indeed, I might, though I am in your service. Consider
then, sir, what you will give me, for, besides serving at
the altar, I was employed to buy provisions.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I won’t deny it. Draw me up a petition of all your claims.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <i>Senhor</i>, do not put me off, for the matter has no ending,
as perhaps you wish, for indeed I am become for you both
clergyman and man of business.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> And I have given you favours, yes, so far as my poor means
allowed, have done more for you than others do. For
what more does a clergyman want in wages or income
than that he should be given his food—a good penny a
day—and allowed to live as he wills. And think of the
honour! “He is chaplain of So-and-So.”</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Yes, and what about clothes, and meals snatched anyhow,
and sleeping so ill at ease that my head lies on the floor
without a pillow, and always at one o’clock in the morning
Mass before the chase? And to please you, moreover,
I served you out of doors, even buying fish in the market-place.
And other errands too, ill befitting my dignity.
Indeed, indeed, sir, I was your carrier on the high road,
driven this way and that; and I had charge of the cats
and of the negroes in the kitchen, and I used to clean your
boots for you, and do many another thing besides.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Yes, I trusted you with all my alms-giving, and you gave
for the love of God, and I never asked you for accounts.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> For the three years to which I’m referring I can give them
now without more ado. You once bade me give
twopence to a blind man in charity.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> I’m not denying it.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<h3><i>THE POOR NOBLEMAN</i></h3>

<p><i>Page.</i> Sir, the goldsmith is here.</p>

<p><i>Nobleman.</i> Show him in. He will be wanting money. Good-day
to you, sir. Put your hat on, please. You have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
great friend in me, and one who sings your merits. I was
praising you only yesterday to the King with all my might,
and I know he will employ you, and I will help you in
this as often as I can. For sometimes such help is better
than a pension, and you know well the value of your
reputation and other such things.</p>

<p><i>Goldsmith.</i> Sir, I will serve him with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Do you know what I like about you—I said so to the King,
and it is greatly to your credit: you do not mind if you
are paid or left unpaid. I never saw such patience, such
superiority, such a will to please.</p>

<p><i>G.</i> Our account is so small and so long overdue that it is dying
of hope deferred, and to present it fills me with
presentiment.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> O, how skilfully you limn your speech. Glad indeed am
I not to have paid you so as to hear you hammer out your
words so well.</p>

<p><i>G.</i> Sir, I kiss your hands, but would gladly see what is mine
in mine.</p>

<p><i>N.</i> Another courtier’s phrase! “Sir, I kiss your hands, but
would gladly see what is mine in mine!” O, what fine
flowers of speech!<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Political Press.</div>

<p>It is the misfortune of existing Portuguese politics and of the
Portuguese Press that the party-leader is often a newspaper-editor.
If we imagine Mr. Balfour as Leader
of the Conservatives and editor and leader-writer
of the <i>Morning Post</i>, Mr. Asquith as
Leader of the Liberals and editor of the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>,
Mr. Lloyd George at the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald
at a paper of his own, we have some idea on a large
scale of the state of affairs in Portugal. “Men are rarely good
judges in their own interests,” one of the characters in Francisco
de Sá de Miranda’s play, <i>Os Vilhalpandos</i>, informs us.
The Latin temperament, with its many merits and excellences,
its logical and intelligent outlook, rarely has the quality of
objective justice. It is too fervent and impassioned, loves and
hates too ardently to pause to consider coldly the fairness of
a matter. All the more welcome would be some independent
organs in the Lisbon Press, some steadying element, some kind
of Portuguese <i>Spectator</i>. As to partisan newspapers, there
are far too many of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journalism.</div>

<p>At Lisbon alone—if we include all kinds and descriptions
of periodical publications—there are upwards of a hundred,
and the majority of these are political. There
are too many writers, who drift from a
Coimbra degree into journalism at Lisbon,
and who consider it far less important to write good Portuguese
than to drag in some French or Latin quotation in and
out of season, and most often misspelt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese and Portugibberish.</div>

<p>It is worth while to consider the sad case of the Portuguese
language, since it is or might be one of the finest languages
in Europe. It is to be hoped that the Bible Society will
distribute far and wide the Portuguese translation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Bible by João Ferreira d’Almeida among all, peasants and
others, who can read. It may not convert them to Protestantism,
but will lay the basis for a revival of
the Portuguese language, murdered daily in
the Press. It is not only the Latin tags that
are misspelt; in spite of the intricate official rules drawn up
for Portuguese spelling, it remains unfixed, and words are
sometimes transformed almost out of recognition. <i>E</i>, being
often pronounced as <i>i</i>, becomes so written, <i>s</i> takes the place
of <i>c</i>, and when these and other errors combine the result is
remarkable; for instance, “scepticism” becomes <i>siticismo</i>,
“miscellany” <i>mecellanea</i>, and so forth. The most minute
rules of Portuguese orthography were drawn up after the
Revolution. They went so far as to forbid you to write
Sarah, while permitting <i>ah</i> and <i>oh</i>, with final H(<i>aga</i>). The
confusion has only become worse confounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polysyllables.</div>

<p>The Portuguese language as spoken in the provinces and by
the peasants is far clearer and more attractive than as it is
often spoken at Lisbon. As to the written
language, it is too often debased by Gallicisms
and by sesquipedalian words. It appears to
shun directness like the plague. A “large crowd” becomes
an “innumerable multitude,” a “fine view” is an “admirable
panorama,” a horse is a solipede, a dog is <i>um exemplar canino</i>
(<i>O Seculo</i>, 21st June, 1915). The terse phrase, “Wait and
see,” translated into modern Portuguese, would become
“Will you have the goodness to adopt an attitude of expectation
and devote yourself to a consideration of the
progress of events.” A sentence is often a great wave
of abstract terms which leaves the reader stunned and
breathless. Take the following from the <i>Parnasso Portuguez
Moderno</i> (Lisbon, 1877): “A par das grandes
descobertas scientificas do nosso seculo que pela via
inductiva conduziram á demonstração integral dos phenomenos
cosmicos pelo movimento etherodynamico.” All that
this really means is “Beside the great discoveries made by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
science in our time in cosmic phenomena.” Or attempt to
extract the character of the unfortunate Luis de Camões from
this: “A forma da genialidade de Camões não foi a de uma
sobrexcitação da sensibilidade mantendo em estado morbido os
elementos nervosos; a boa cultura synthetica, completandose
pela synessia da sua vida em diversissimos meios teve um
objectivo para onde convergiram todas as assimilisações
mentaes e adaptações praticas.” In a single page of one recent
novel occur no less than fourteen abstract words ending in <i>-ade</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True Portuguese.</div>

<p>Yet there is ample evidence to show that Portuguese at its
best is well qualified to rival or even excel Castilian. It has
by nature that softness and pliancy which
the Castilian only attains exceptionally, at
the hands of genius, and in Portuguese it is
for the master hand to give this language that force and concision
which comes naturally to the Castilian, and which
was once a characteristic of Portuguese also. The saying,
“Fortune usually kicks a man when he’s down,” is expressed
in Portuguese in three words, “<i>Sobre queda coices</i>”—“after
fall kicks,” and innumerable words are in Portuguese reduced
to half the length they have in Latin and in other modern
Romance languages. <i>Solus</i>, alone, becomes <i>só</i>; <i>dolor</i>, grief,
<i>dôr</i>, <i>major môr</i>. As to its softness, delightful words such as
<i>chuva</i>, rain, and all those words expressive of bittersweet
regret and similar feelings—<i>saudade</i>, <i>saudoso</i>, <i>meigo</i>, <i>mavioso</i>—occur
continually. But the tendency has been always to
praise and exaggerate this softness, whereas it needs a corrective
of terseness if it is not to become excessive. Even
occasional harshnesses of construction are not amiss. The
uglinesses and thicknesses of Portuguese pronunciation and
spelling are of comparatively modern growth. Open some
folio of the sixteenth century, and you will find not the nasal
<i>ão</i>, but the straightforward <i>am</i>, not <i>prompto</i> but <i>pronto</i>, not
<i>lucta</i> but <i>luta</i>, not <i>tracto</i> but <i>trato</i>—everything clearer and more
direct. And as the scholar goes to his books the politician
must turn to the people, not the people to which the Lisbon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
political press addresses itself, but the inhabitants of the
remote provinces which have remained as stationary as old
folios in a convent library, and preserve many uncorrupted
excellences of language and custom. And indeed this is no
matter of vain pedantry: for unless the language, and the
citizens too, hark back to the sixteenth century, they are
doomed to perish. No great literature can come of Portuguese
as it is at present too often spoken and written, and
without a literature a nation dwindles and dies. (Witness
the Basques, who have the vigour of six ordinary nations, and
are losing their language and nationality because they have
never given much attention to the written word, content with
their splendid old games and customs.) It is a pity that
the passion for politics in Portugal has not inspired its devotees
with nobler prose; though there are some journalists who are
also men of letters, the majority of articles published are
scarcely written in anything worthy of the name of prose, and
this is the more regrettable as politics in Portugal stretches its
net so wide, and thousands read the newspaper who have
never opened a book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Political Octopus.</div>

<p>Nearly a century ago, that is at about the time of the
introduction into Portugal of constitutional government, a
Portuguese writer proposed that the vanity
of his countrymen should be turned to
account by bestowing such titles as Viscount
and Baron on rich persons according as they built a large or
small number of houses, a large or small village in the more
deserted parts of the country. Succeeding governments
seemed to adopt the suggestion, only the titles were given
systematically to those rich <i>brazileiros</i> and others who paid
in so many <i>contos</i> to the public exchequer or who helped by
their local influence to win an election. Thus, politics became
more and more a dreadful octopus, its tentacles closing round
and crushing the life out of the nation. Even those who do
not know a ballot-box from a sheep-trough or a Minister
from a counter-jumper, find themselves compelled to take part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
in politics. They may gain nothing from it, but they cannot
escape it. And if a man wishes to get anything done, if he
desires a road mended, a church built, a son placed, a title
conferred, an opponent imprisoned, it is possible to arrange
the matter, by means of politics. As to Lisbon, of course,
it would not be Lisbon were it not for politics. Alas for the
clubs of the Chiado, the <i>cafés</i> of the Rocio, the arcades of
Black House Square, and even the shops, the streets, the
<i>praças</i>, where men do gather together and gossip, were there
not a new government to discuss every three or four months.
The country may be driven to the dogs by these continual
changes, but the politicians, amateur and professional, are
in clover. And indeed this soft air and warm sun needs a
spice of <i>maledicencia</i> and criticism of politicians. In England
the climate affords an abundant topic, in Portugal the days
are often monotonously beautiful, sometimes monotonously
rainy, so that whereas people in England discuss a late fall of
snow or an early frost, in Portugal they pass the time over the
fall of the Government or a partial ministerial crisis. A
wonderful amount of excellent wit and intelligence is expended
over the subject, and it is extraordinary how every shopkeeper
even, every newspaper-boy almost, has his political views,
his favourite politician. Men whose education consists in
being able to spell out the newspaper of their predilection will
discuss the political situation with considerable eloquence
and knowledge. Each political group counts as many real
adherents as may fit into a not very large hall, and each
politician who takes office is the target at which all the other
political groups aim the shafts of their ridicule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political Groups.</div>

<p>Nowhere have political parties been more numerous and
more picturesque in their names and their theories than in
Spain and Portugal. In Spain at a recent
general election members of nearly a dozen
political parties were returned to Parliament,
and in Portugal since the introduction of constitutional government
there have been <i>Cartistas</i> and <i>Septembristas</i>, <i>Regeneradores</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
<i>Dissidentes</i>, <i>Reformistas</i>, <i>Nacionalistas</i>, <i>Progressistas</i>, and
since the Revolution of 1910, <i>Evolucionistas</i>, <i>Independentes</i>,
<i>Reformistas</i>, <i>Integralistas</i>, <i>Unionistas</i>, and <i>Democratas</i>. These
are but a few of the many parties which have misinterpreted
and abused the Parliamentary system in Portugal, some of
them with names and actions as vague as Emilio Castelar’s
celebrated <i>Posibilistas</i>. To take the present time there are
the “Democrats” under the leadership of Dr. Affonso Augusto
da Costa (their chief newspaper organs are <i>O Mundo</i>, <i>A Montanha</i>
and <i>A Patria</i>), the “Evolutionists” under the leadership of
Dr. José Antonio de Almeida (organ, <i>A Republica</i>), the
“Unionists,” led by Dr. Manuel Brito Camacho (<i>A Lucta</i>),
the “Independents” or <i>Reformistas</i> under Senhor Machado
Santos (<i>O Intransigente</i>). The Democrats consider themselves
the direct continuation of the original Republican party,
and thus in a sense the only legitimate party, the others having
branched off from it since the Revolution. These four are the
definitely constituted Republican parties, besides which there
are the more advanced Radical Republicans, the Syndicalists
(<i>O Sindicalista</i>), Socialists (<i>O Socialista</i>), etc. There are also
the Miguelists (<i>A Nação</i>), Manuelists (<i>O Dia</i>), and a Royalist
party which may be called Sebastianist, and which vaguely
desires the return of former conditions without having any
very definite political creed. It must be remembered that
there are but a million and a half Portuguese who can read
and write, and that the Republic has disfranchised the
remaining 4,500,000. But even of the 1,500,000 the majority
take no active part in politics. The parties are in fact small
personal groups collecting round any politician of intelligence
or energy, or who knows the political ropes and the art of
placing or promising to place his friends, and as a consequence
they are too much inclined to give prominence to small personal
questions and storms in the Lisbon teacup. The followers
of the various parties are also known as <i>Affonsistas</i>,
<i>Almeidistas</i>, <i>Camachistas</i>, as before the Revolution there were
<i>Franquistas</i>, <i>Henriquistas</i>, <i>Teixeiristas</i>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ministries and Elections.</div>

<p>These groups bicker with all the venom of personal hatred
amid the most profound indifference of the country. The
formation of a new party or a new ministry
has nothing to do with the country. Even
were elections in Portugal to be regarded as
a sign of the people’s will, there had been but one general
election since the Revolution at a time when the number of
governments had to be counted on the fingers of both hands,
and the Ministers of Finance on fingers and toes. So a new
party will spring up in Lisbon and have little root in the
country outside Lisbon. The attitude of the people towards
all these politicians is one of profound distrust. They give
them credit for sufficient intelligence to understand their own
interests, but not sufficient to understand the interests of the
country. A peasant in one of Eça de Queiroz’ novels is of
opinion that <i>quem manda lucra</i>, and this melancholy sentiment
(that he who has charge of affairs feathers his nest) may be
heard at the present day. It is not said in anger, but as the
expression of a very natural fact. They would be surprised
if it were otherwise. While the unfortunate Minister of
Finance is gazing at an empty exchequer, they imagine him
plunging both hands in a rich store for himself and his friends.
And in a sense they are right. It is expected of ministers in
office to help their friends, in their business affairs, and to find
places for their political followers somewhere in that huge
bureaucracy which has been the bane of Portugal since the
sixteenth century. And, of course, each new government
appoints new civil governors and new mayors and usually
many other officials in the provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brief Ministries.</div>

<p>When it is remembered that Portugal has had some twenty
governments during the life of a single government in England,
it will be readily understood what disastrous
confusion, what expense and waste, result,
not to speak of personal ambitions kept
continually at fever heat, on the watch and intriguing for some
official post, and the large army of ex-officials disinclined or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
unable to find other employment. The list of Governments
in the seven years 1908-15 is—save omissions—as follows:
(1) João Franco, (2) Amaral, (3) Henriques, (4) Telles, (5) Lima,
(6) Beirão, (7) Teixeira de Sousa, (8) Provisional Government,
(9) João Chagas, (10) Vasconcellos, (11), Duarte Leite, (12)
Costa, (13) Machado, (14) Azevedo, (15) Pimenta de Castro,
(16) Revolutionary Government (João Chagas), (17) José
de Castro, (18) José de Castro with new ministry. The
first regular Republican Parliament (1911-14) saw the rise
and fall of seven governments, and the rise and fall of each
of them made as little commotion in the country (apart from
the habitual discussions of the <i>cafés</i> and political clubs in the
towns) as a pebble thrown into the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Making the Elections.</div>

<p>How can this be so, it may be asked, with the deputies of
the nation sitting in Parliament? The answer is that elections
in Portugal are a peculiar practice. The
phrase “The Government makes the elections”
obtains in Portugal as in Spain, and
of itself speaks volumes. The Government is first appointed
by some personal intrigue in Lisbon, with or without reference,
or with a purely formal reference to the strength of the various
parties in Parliament. It then proceeds to remodel the political
framework throughout the country by appointing civil
governors, mayors, etc., of its own political views. Then,
when it is well seated in the saddle, it holds the elections. It
is an unknown thing for a majority to be returned other than
of the supporters of the Government. This would be discouraging
to the electors (and also it would be impossible) if
they took any interest in the results, but the results are always
a foregone conclusion except in matters of detail. Senhor
Affonso Costa after he had as Premier obtained thirty-four
out of thirty-seven seats in a partial election, remarked in a
speech to his party, the Democrats: “The country will
give us more next time.” That is, the Democrat Government
which had made the election was scarcely content to have
obtained all except two or three seats, but better luck next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
time: one must not ask too much. “For the first time,” said
Senhor Bernardino Machado after the Revolution, “there
is going to be in this country an election without the intervention
of the Government.” “The whole country must be
fully convinced that it is not the Government that makes the
Constituent Assembly” (from a speech delivered in December,
1910). Of course the thing was impossible, the country
had not been brought up to use its own discretion at an
election. At a meeting of the Provisional Government and
the Directory of the Republican Party held in the very
month in which these words were spoken and attended by
Senhor Bernardino Machado who had spoken them, it was
resolved to “bring to bear all the forces of the party without
exception in their official organisation in order thus to prevent
the adversaries of the Republic from introducing themselves
disguisedly into the politics of the nation to disturb it.”
Openly, of course, no Royalist would dare to present himself
after such an invitation or warning. Yet the question has
sometimes been put with a spider-and-fly blandness of hypocrisy:
“Why do the Royalists not present themselves for
election instead of conspiring?” although, with organised
groups employed for “the defence of the Republic,”
the Royalists who did so would have been more likely to see
the inside of the <i>Penitenciaria</i> than of the House of Parliament.
Sincere Republicans admit that the first Republican Parliament
was artificially fabricated in Lisbon, and it is difficult
to see how it could be otherwise: generations must pass before
a really representative assembly can exist in Portugal. Meanwhile,
<i>fit, non nascitur</i>. A candid member of the majority in
the Chamber of Deputies addressed the little shrivelled
minority in 1911 with the words: “Vocês, se vieram á
Camara, foi porque nós quizemos” (“You are only here on
sufferance”). In 1907 Senhor João Chagas was exclaiming
against the fictions, lies, fraud, mockery of the elections:
“In Portugal the Government makes the elections....
In our country it is not the people that elects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
its representatives: it is the Civil Governors and the
Mayors.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Centralisation.</div>

<p>His words are still applicable, and recent years have
fastened even more closely upon the country that political
centralisation originally derived from Napoleon’s
system, and which gives excellent
results only so long as an administrative genius
is at the head of affairs. The country is more and more a
motionless and paralysed victim in the strait-waistcoat of
an administration which is little but politics, and the cost of
which exceeds, relatively, even that of France. The Revolution
brought the charge of even greater interference of
politics, otherwise the political system has remained much as
before. <i>Leges non animam mutant.</i> The new electoral law
has been described even by Republicans as being drawn up
on the lines of the old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rotativism.</div>

<p><i>O Seculo</i> in a leading article said (5th November, 1911):
“We must confess that the transformation of the old methods
has not attained the required extent. There
seems to be a wish to continue a life of personal
politics.” The famous rotativism of
the Monarchy, by which parties succeeded one another to
power without any reference to the country, and with but
little reference to its nominal representatives in Parliament,
did not cease with the Revolution. “Nefarious rotativism is
still with us,” said <i>O Seculo</i> a year later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sincere Republicans.</div>

<p><i>A Republica</i>, a year later again (18th October, 1912)
remarked in a leading article: “The truth is that, in two years
of Republic, political cabals, persecutions, the
boldness of the incompetent, the unscrupulousness
of the ambitious, the indiscipline
of nearly everyone, and the cowardice of the greater number,
have prevented the Republic from entering frankly upon a
system of careful administration.... We are continuing
the system of mere words which was our glory in opposition
but is our disgrace in power.” And a little later (24th March,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
1913): “The country is tired. It is tired especially of the
enormous lie that we have given it, as it looks upon a Republic
which taxes arbitrarily, arrests and persecutes arbitrarily,
governs and administers arbitrarily.” “We are living in
anarchy as regards administration,” said Dr. Brito Canacho
in <i>A Lucta</i> a month later. And Senhor Machado Santos,
one of the founders of the Republic, soon found that the
Republic did not answer to his dreams, and was not slow to
say so in his newspaper, <i>O Intransigente</i>: “The Republic
is very different from what the people had imagined, and as
a result the majority has relapsed into indifference, while
others, passing the limits of all reason, beat the record of
petty and passionate politics” (3rd November, 1911). “Politics
under the Monarchy brought the Portuguese nation to
ruin, and politics under the Republic instead of being completely
different, has adopted the old methods,” and “in
fourteen months has done more harm than fourteen years of
politics during the Monarchy” (13th December, 1911).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disillusion.</div>

<p>The peasants had remained indifferent from the first,
where they were not secretly hostile to the Republic, but the
workmen of the towns, or more accurately,
of Lisbon, were bitterly disappointed. They
noted “the enormous difference” between the
words and deeds of the Republicans and that “everything
is now sacrificed to the creeping politics of the <i>bourgeois</i>, who
above the interests of the country set the ambitions of their
politicians” (<i>A Voz do Operario</i>, 1st December, 1912). The
Socialists reserved for themselves the right to “adopt the
revolutionary methods so freely advocated formerly by the
Republicans.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies.</div>

<p>It will be seen from the above quotations that Republicans
have acknowledged that politics before the Revolution and
politics after the Revolution were as much
alike as the names of Muppim and Huppim,
those sons of Benjamin. Sincere Republicans
admit it; it is more difficult to find a remedy. When education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
has done its work these party groups may possibly, no
doubt, broaden out into political parties with real root in the
country, but it will be a process of centuries. And meanwhile,
unfortunately, the Republicans, dissatisfied with the results
of the Revolution, have recourse to a different remedy—more
revolution—and try to cure themselves with a hair of the dog
that has bitten them. Decentralisation, of course, is incompatible
with the government by personal groups at Lisbon in
the name of the nation. The new administrative code, if
it is willing to take power from the mayors, is not willing to
give it to the municipal bodies. Whatever authority is taken
from the mayors is given not to locally elected corporations,
but to other officials, mere instruments and offshoots of the
central power. And indeed Portugal is scarcely ready yet
for local autonomy. It is not ready for the parliamentary
system, and the scrupulous care with which it and all constitutional
forms are observed sometimes increases instead of
diminishes the difficulty of a situation. The hope is that by
maintaining the forms strictly, they will gradually become a
living system instead of an empty framework, but that hope is
indefinitely deferred owing to the number of political groups
and the virulence of their personal animosities and ambitions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Party Politics.</div>

<p>Two great parties, instead of a number of personal groups,
might yet succeed in extending their influence in the country,
were they to adopt simple, practical programmes.
But it is hopeless to expect that
a programme, however simple, will be carried
out so long as there are three or four Ministries to the year.
Six or seven years should be the average length of a government,
and the elections should be held at the end of that time,
not at the beginning of its career: that is, the Government
should ask the country to keep it in office if satisfied with
what it has achieved, not merely inform the country that it
has achieved its object of establishing itself in power. It was
a brave and excellent precept of the late Spanish Premier,
Señor Canalejas, whose assassination was so heavy a loss to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Spanish politics, when he said: “I mean to remain in office a
long time” (<i>Yo me propongo seguir mucho tiempo en mi puesto</i>),
and the most praiseworthy achievement of Dr. Affonso Costa
as Premier was that he did in the face of attacks from all sides
and every criticism, succeed in remaining in office without a
single change of Minister (one does not trouble to knock down
puppets) for a whole year. Perhaps some more conciliatory
Premier, who is not a mere party politician, with power based
precariously in demagogy, may yet continue in office for five.
It would make politics duller, but the country would gain
undoubtedly. A Liberal and a Conservative Government
succeeding one another at long intervals, and really making
some effort to interest the people and base their authority in
the will of the people, must be the aim of Portuguese politics
for the present. Then in a century or two, when education
has become general and communications have improved, it
will be discovered that Portugal is an excellent country for
government by referendum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prominent Party Politicians.</div>

<p>But for the present the Lisbon politicians continue to
pipe to the country, and the country refuses to dance to their
piping. The Provisional Government, formed
immediately after the Revolution under the
presidency of Dr. Theophilo Braga,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> comprised
Dr. Antonio José de Almeida<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> as Minister of
the Interior, Dr. Bernardino Machado<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> as Minister for Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
Affairs, Dr. Brito Camacho<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> as Minister of Public Works, and
Dr. Affonso Costa<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> as Minister of Justice. So far only one
party existed, called the <i>Partido Republicano</i>, but after
the Provisional Government had come to an end Dr. Almeida
dissociated himself from it to form what he called the Evolutionist
Republican party, while a third party, the Unionist
(<i>União Nacional Republicano</i>), was constituted under the
leadership of Dr. Brito Camacho. Both these parties were
slightly more Conservative in character, and in the Evolutionists
especially this tendency was subsequently accentuated.
Yet the <i>Partido Republicano</i>, under the leadership of Dr.
Costa, continued to regard itself as the only Republican party.
In a sense this was true, since the Republicans, in the words
of Senhor Guerra Junqueiro, at the end of last century, are
a party of “demolition rather than reconstruction.” Dr. Costa
and his party have been excellent demolishers. Senhor
Machado Santos,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who had led the Republican troops in
October, 1910, in Lisbon, and is sometimes called the Founder
of the Republic, constituted himself the candid critic of
Republican political tendencies, and gathered round him a
small group of Independents. But none of these dissenting
leaders have had the strength to form a Ministry of their own,
and the Conservative side of Republican politics has existed
rather in theory than in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Affonso Costa.</div>

<p>Of the Republican politicians, the most forcible, persistent,
and unscrupulous, has been Dr. Affonso Costa. Dr. Brito
Camacho has beside him the air of a retired
thinker and student, while Dr. Antonio José
d’Almeida has the reputation of being more
of an idealist than a practical politician. Dr. Costa was
described once in <i>Le Temps</i> as being likely to play “un rôle
en évidence dans les manifestations de la rue.” He is a
clever lawyer, quick to see his advantage and follow it up,
but lacking far-sightedness and breadth of view. He has the
strength of his narrowness, and may be called an inverted
João Franco. But he is essentially a party politician, not
a statesman. In all opposition, in every <i>contretemps</i>, he sees
the hand of clericalism and the Jesuits, using anti-clericalism
as a cement to keep his party together. His power has been
built up and based on the art of the demagogue, and by
controlling the mob and organised groups of Carbonarios he
was able to control the destinies of the Republic during times
of disorder, and to upset any government with which he
disagreed. But if his hold on the mob has made him arbiter
of the Republic he has also suffered at the hands of his
supporters, and might well pray to be delivered from his
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Puff Politician.</div>

<p>The strange paeans of praise in <i>O Mundo</i>, poems to his
<i>vulto imortal</i>, the resolve of an admirer to order a life-like
silver statue of him, the arrest of persons
for speaking ill of him, the arrest of others
accused of wishing to assassinate him, as
well as his own extraordinary speeches in Parliament and out
of Parliament, showing an ignorance of the conditions of life
in Portugal almost as profound as his ignorance of the conditions
in foreign countries, might well have crushed him
beneath a load of ridicule, but have merely served to keep him
in the public eye. As to the attempts at assassinating him,
these puffs of his political admirers are now quite discredited.
One of the supposed murderers arrested at Santarem was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
found to be armed with nothing more deadly than a small
pocket-knife, others arrested at the <i>Praia das Maçãs</i>, in the
summer of 1913, were released as innocent after a year and
a half’s imprisonment; another, this time a schoolboy, had
a pistol put into his hand by Dr. Costa’s puffers, but fired so
badly that he did not even succeed in hitting the railway
carriage in which Dr. Costa was going to travel. His opponents
must be fools indeed if they do not realise how greatly
his party would gain were a real attempt made to assassinate
him. He would be at once converted from a pleasant nonentity
to a martyr, a kind of Portuguese Ferrer. Certainly
Dr. Affonso Costa has been the politician most in evidence
since the Revolution. It is rumoured that he keeps a large
number of dogs and cuts off the tail of one of them Alcibiades-fashion
as occasion offers, but this is almost certainly a calumnious
invention, cruelty to animals being quite foreign to his
nature. But it was almost pathetic to see how, at the advent
of a statesman, he withered away politically as if he had met
the Snark, and turned to conspiracy and revolution in order to
overthrow him. For General Pimenta de Castro,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> though not
a party politician, showed truer statesmanship than all the
party-leaders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Democrats.</div>

<p>A return of the Democrats to power must be disastrous for
many reasons, and the way the country would be thrown into
fresh unrest and the prisons filled may be
gauged from the fact that the Democrats
are wonderfully vindictive, and are already
marking out names of persons for arrest and of buildings
(of Royalist newspapers, Conservative clubs, etc.) for attack.
Vindictiveness in Portugal, especially in political questions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
is carried to extraordinary lengths, and the man marked down
for political persecution has to be continually on his guard.
Perhaps years are allowed to pass, and the victim is given no
inkling of hostility; perhaps he had left the country and
returns to live peacefully and obscurely; then when he least
expects it he will find himself in gaol or stabbed or shot.
A foreigner will give far less offence if he adopts a detached,
amused, supercilious attitude than if he studies Portuguese
politics sincerely from a Portuguese point of view, and considers
what is the best remedy for the country. But all who
prefer to breathe the sweet air of Heaven rather than that of
the prisons of Portugal, would do well to club together, and
keep the “Democrats” out of office until they have moderated
their inquisitorial ardour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Carbonaria.</div>

<p>As to the Carbonarios, it is hoped that if the Royalists
refrain from any violent demonstrations these devoted defenders
of the Republic in and out of season will
gradually disappear. The society was founded
as early as 1823 in imitation, or rather in
desecration, of the Italians who conspired against the yoke of
Austria, and was reorganised in 1848. It was, however,
chiefly after the abortive Republican rising of the 31st of
January, 1891, that the <i>Carbonarios</i> gained in strength and,
organised in small separate groups, in <i>choças</i>, <i>barracas</i>, and
<i>vendas</i>, became the most powerful political force in
the country. Their numbers in October, 1910, have
been variously estimated at 40,000, 32,000, or a much
lower figure. It is impossible to say, but it is certain
that since the Revolution, while the old Carbonarios were not
disbanded, new sets sprang up, organised by the Republican
parties “for the defence of the Republic.” The Democrats
especially advanced hand in hand with the Carbonarios,
forming an army of Carbonario spies in their service, till in
1913 they came into office together. These new bodies of
“insolent neo-Carbonarios,” as a Republican newspaper
described them, spread distrust and unrest through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
country, spying, insulting, arresting. “They allow us not
a moment of tranquillity” (<i>A Republica</i>, 12th December,
1912). “There is no corner of the country now without a nest
of Carbonarios,” wrote Senhor Machado Santos a year after
the Revolution in <i>O Intransigente</i>, 3rd November, 1911. And
these nests were not composed, principally, of the old Carbonarios.
Thus, it was possible for Dr. Affonso Costa, when
Premier, to say in the Chamber of Deputies that he considered
the <i>Carbonarios</i> should have been disbanded after the
Revolution, referring to the old <i>Carbonarios</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White Antics.</div>

<p>The words naturally did not apply to the post-revolution
brands, such as that of the “White Ants,” which at the very
time that Dr. Costa spoke thus were being
actively organised by his Government. According
to the statements made in Parliament
by Senhor Alberto Silveira, who during three years after the
Revolution of 1910 was head of the Lisbon police, these
White Ants (often suitably dressed in antique black, with
flowing black ties), organised during Dr. Costa’s Premiership,
included “some who gave their services with a view to future
employment, others who contented themselves with payment
in money.” Some “belonged to Carbonario associations
created since the Revolution by individuals of low social and
moral status.” “Others came from revolutionary clubs,
such as the ‘Radical Club’; some were anarchists openly
hostile to the existing <i>régime</i>.” Some used cards with
<i>G. Civil</i> printed on them, standing for <i>Grupo Civil</i>, but intended
to convey to their victims the official authority of the <i>Governo
Civil</i>. Groups (<i>nucleos de vigilancia</i>) had been formed for the
defence of the Republic, said Dr. Costa on another occasion,
at the meeting of the Republican (Democrat) Party
at Aveiro in April, 1913, and had been such a success that
they would be continued. But officially, of course, the
<i>Carbonaria</i> does not exist, the Government knows nothing
about it, and if you ask a <i>Carbonario</i> he will answer that there
is no such thing in Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Delenda est Carbonaria.</div>

<p>There should be no such society in Portugal. It is not
needed and only serves to spread a feeling of distrust and
discomfort in daily life, which can only be
paralleled by the state of suspicion and disquiet
under some of the Roman Emperors or
in the heyday of the Spanish Inquisition. Or if it is needed
to prop up the Republic, the Republic by that very fact stands
condemned. But the Carbonarios should understand that
their services are no longer required, and take a well-earned
rest. If they do not and, encouraged by a certain section of
the Republican Press, commit fresh outrages, they will signally
help the Royalist cause and hasten the Restoration. Almost
the worst feature of the last few years has been the encouragement
given by the Democrat Press to attack the life and
property of priests, Roman Catholics, and Royalists. Such
a journalist as the editor of <i>O Mundo</i> was indirectly responsible
for the death of Lieutenant Soares and other murders
and should have been punished accordingly. The liberty of
the Press cannot be held to include toleration of direct incitements
to kill political opponents. The <i>Mundo</i> is all the more
dangerous in that it is not read by the educated, but by
ignorant persons, who have no means of knowing how false
and insidious are many of its contents.</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM MONARCHY TO REPUBLIC</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Last Years of Dom Carlos’ Reign.</div>

<p>At the opening of the twentieth century, Dom Carlos was
in the twelfth year of his reign, and Senhor Hintze Ribeiro
(d. 1st August, 1907) was his Prime Minister.
The Parliamentary system copied from England
was in use, with the difference that
whereas in England the political views of the
Government depend on the result of the elections, in Portugal
the result of the elections depended on the political views of
the Government which “made” them, after the Government
itself had been made for personal or party reasons at Lisbon.
The two principal parties, were the <i>Regenerador</i> or Conservative,
under the leadership of Senhor Hintze Ribeiro, and the
<i>Progressista</i> or Liberal, under the leadership of Senhor José
Luciano de Castro (d. 9th March, 1914). These continued to
alternate in power by a system of connivance and compromise
known as Rotativism. The <i>Regenerador</i> Ministry of Senhor
Hintze Ribeiro lasted from 25th June, 1900, till 1904. In an
earlier <i>Regenerador</i> Ministry under Senhor Hintze Ribeiro the
Minister of the Interior had been Senhor João Franco, who
in 1901 separated himself from the <i>Regenerador</i> party. In 1903
he formed a new party entitled <i>Regenerador Liberal</i>. With
the resignation of Senhor Hintze Ribeiro in 1904, Senhor José
Luciano de Castro came into office, and held the elections in
the following year. In March, 1906, Senhor Hintze Ribeiro
was again Premier, but only for a few weeks, during which he
held another general election. The election as a Republican
deputy of Senhor Bernardino Machado gave the populace of
Lisbon an opportunity to show its Republican leanings, and
the severe repression of the demonstration made on his arrival
at Lisbon led indirectly to the fall of the Government. Both
the great parties had now met with such resistance in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
Parliament or in public opinion that they found it impossible
to govern.</p>

<div class="sidenote">João Franco.</div>

<p>On the 18th of May, King Carlos, breaking through the
Rotativism which has been so frequently attacked, turned to
the <i>Regenerador Liberal</i> party, and its leader,
Senhor João Franco, became Premier. The
King considered that he had found the “man
of character” to put the political house in order, and he
openly said so, thereby giving great offence to all the other
politicians who amazingly fitted on the cap, and said: “He
accuses us of political corruption.” Senhor Franco had come
into office with the support of the <i>Progressistas</i>, under Senhor
José Luciano de Castro, without which, indeed, it would have
been impossible for him to control the Parliamentary situation.
In the new Parliament, elected in August, four Republicans
were elected, including Dr. Antonio José de Almeida and
Dr. Affonso Costa; Senhor Hintze Ribeiro’s party (the
<i>Regenerador</i>) was represented by thirty deputies, Senhor
Castro’s by over forty, while the Government secured for itself
only seventy. So long as the new Premier could count on
the votes of the forty-three <i>Progressista</i> deputies, he was able
to face the noisy scenes of the Chamber, but when that
support was withdrawn a few months later it only remained
for him to resign or to dissolve Parliament. Since the leaders
of the <i>Regeneradores</i> and of the <i>Progressistas</i> had both within
the last few months come to a similar dilemma, and there was
no likelihood of finding a statesman of stronger character and
greater ability than Senhor Franco, the King accepted the latter
alternative and on 10th May, 1907, Parliament was dissolved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Republicans.</div>

<p>Henceforth Senhor Franco stood alone, the best-hated and
most calumniated man in Lisbon. It was in Lisbon that the
Republicans had principally spread their
doctrines, by gossip, pamphlets, and newspapers
among the half-educated classes, who
received with scandalised anger whatever accounts of Royal
extravagance and of the wickedness of the Jesuits were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
furnished to them. If Senhor Franco was hated in Lisbon,
the King was not much more popular. He himself had summed
up the situation as “a Monarchy without Monarchists,” and
the last Premier of the Monarchy, Senhor Teixeira de Sousa,
declared that the Monarchy fell because it had against it the
passion of many and the indifference of the majority. “There
are no Royalists in Portugal,” said Senhor João Chagas, a
good instance of the bad habit of calling Lisbon Portugal.
The passions were concentrated in Lisbon, and the indifference
in the provinces only served to throw the lurid politics of the
capital into stronger relief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Civil List.</div>

<p>The <i>adeantamentos</i>, that is, sums advanced by the Treasury
for the King’s expenses, were a favourite catchword of the
Republicans, and a frequent motive of
calumny. But when Senhor Franco proposed
to increase the Civil List, which had remained
stationary for the last three-quarters of a century at a <i>conto</i>
(about £200) a day, and do away with the <i>adeantamentos</i>, the
storm of opposition and abuse only increased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stormy Opposition.</div>

<p>Here was a firm and able statesman, anxious to carry
through financial, political and social reforms, and it might
have been expected that he would have
received some support from those who had
the interests of the country at heart. Perhaps
the Republicans considered the reforms too late, or rather a
little too early, since for them the first, the chief, reform was
now a change of <i>régime</i>: reforms did not please them unless
they could be carried out by themselves. But it was not the
Republicans alone who were to blame for the loss of this great
opportunity of restoring order and stable government in
Portugal. If the Republicans shrieked, the Royalist parties
were no less clamorous against Senhor Franco. All those
whose interests were menaced by the proposed reforms, all
the comfortable rotativists and political hypocrites, all those
who wished to gain credit by themselves initiating the reforms,
and hated them when coming from another, were united<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
against Senhor Franco. Senhor Franco, however, did not
lose his head but continued his work with calmness and
courage. He succeeded in decreasing the deficit and giving
some hope of gradually abolishing it altogether. But as the
opposition increased he was obliged to increase the rigour of
his dictatorship. Various newspapers were suspended and
the censorship became very strict. The fact that the suspended
newspapers included <i>O Dia</i>, then the organ of the
<i>Alpoimistas</i> (that is, the <i>Progressistas Dissidentes</i>, under the
leadership of Snr. José Alpoim), <i>O Mundo</i>, a Republican newspaper
then in its eighth year, the Progressista <i>Correio da Noite</i>
and the Regenerador <i>Populo</i> suffices to show the force of the
opposition with which the hated “Dictator” had to contend,
and also how impartial he was in his efforts to effect reforms
which most disinterested persons acknowledged to be excellent
and necessary. He had not begun by employing arbitrary
methods. “The Republican party,” wrote a Portuguese
journalist, “asked above all for liberty, and the first thing
the Government of João Franco did was to give it liberty.
He gave it liberty of the Press and of association; he allowed
it to demonstrate noisily in streets and squares. What was
the result? The Republicans declared in the newspapers
that they did not want the liberty given them by the Government,
and one newspaper even wrote: ‘The more liberty
they give us the more we will require; we must force them
to compromising violence or disgraceful compromise.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Party Passions.</div>

<p>Never have party passions so blinded all the politicians of
a country to that country’s interests as in the violent and,
one may well add, cowardly attacks on Senhor
Franco. There was even a plot to kidnap
him, and place him on a man-of-war in the
Tagus. It is scarcely surprising that Senhor Franco should
have been obliged to resort to methods more arbitrary,
which of course drew scandalised cries of rage from those who
had made them necessary. In Lisbon the lowest interpretation
was placed on all his actions. Senhor Franco had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
delight in violence, but he considered that it was the duty of
a Government to govern, and that if this was rendered impossible
for it by constitutional means it must govern as best it
might. The dictatorship was only temporary, in fact the
elections were fixed for April of the following year (1908).
But with the extraordinary respect for convention and nice
superficial scruples about formalities that characterises
Portuguese politics (which sometimes seems to be a game
to see who has the skill to govern most constitutionally and
worst), a certain number of Royalists preferred to go over to
the Republic than to acquiesce in anything so unconstitutional
(and opposed to their interests) as the dictatorship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrest of the Conspirators.</div>

<p>Could Senhor Franco have counted on the support of public
opinion outside Lisbon he might have mastered the situation,
but the mass of the people continued as usual
remote and apathetic, and it only remained
for him to order the arrest of those whose
avowed object was to make government
impossible. Never under the Monarchy was a Republican
arrested because he was a Republican. Republicans were
allowed to retain high office in the army and in the civil
service. But the men now arrested were known to have
entered into a definite conspiracy to overthrow the Government
and to seize the person of the Premier, if not to kill him.
In January, not for the first time, a turbulent Republican
journalist, Snr. João Chagas, was arrested, as also a more
dangerous because more underhand Republican, Snr. França
Borges, of the <i>Mundo</i>. The arrest of the Republican deputy,
Snr. Affonso Costa and of the Visconde de Ribeira Brava,
followed a week later (28th January, 1908). Dr. Antonio
José de Almeida had been arrested a few days before. These
were the darlings of a certain and not the most orderly section
of the Lisbon people, and on their arrest disturbances occurred
which were suppressed by the Civil Guard. And here it may
be remarked that while Snr. Franco held the perfectly legitimate
view that order must be maintained at all costs, he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
scarcely be held responsible for the way in which his orders
were carried out in detail. The methods of the Lisbon police
and soldiers of the Guard are strange and ill calculated to
lessen the anger of a crowd. Even under the Republic mounted
soldiers of the Guard have been known to slash with their
naked swords at innocent persons standing on the pavement
who did not amount in all to a dozen, and were not dreaming
of revolt or rebellion, being armed only with the not very
warlike weapons known as umbrellas. The suppression of
riots in January, 1908, was no doubt characterised by the
same methods. A decree of January 31st (anniversary of
the rising at Oporto in 1891, from which the Republican
movement really dates) came to set a fine edge on the indignation
of the Lisbon Republicans, who had been schooled to
believe the worst of Snr. Franco and the King. By a decree
of the preceding November political crimes were to come
before three judges, the <i>Juge d’Instruction Criminelle</i> and two
coadjutors, their verdict to be without appeal. The new
decree allowed the Government to interfere and banish the
accused. (Not for a moment was there any idea of
imprisoning these confessed conspirators in the <i>Penitenciaria</i>.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of the King and of the Crown Prince.</div>

<p>Like lightning the news spread through Lisbon, exaggerated
into the announcement that all the Republican leaders were
to be deported to Africa. King Carlos was,
with the Queen and the Crown Prince, at
Villa Viçosa, to the south of the Tagus, but
was returning to Lisbon on the following day.
The report was diligently circulated that he
was coming in order to sign a decree deporting Snr. Affonso
Costa and the other leaders. The King was met at the quay
of the <i>Terreiro do Paço</i>, or “Black Horse Square,” by Prince
Manoel, and the Premier, Snr. Franco, and entered an open
carriage with Queen Amélie, the Crown Prince, and Prince
Manoel. The carriage was about to leave the spacious
<i>Terreiro do Paço</i> when several men sprang towards it, and in
an instant Dom Carlos and the Crown Prince fell back mortally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
wounded by several bullets. The Queen was seen standing
up in the carriage waving her bouquet of flowers in order to
deflect the aim of the assassins. The Infante Manoel was
slightly wounded in the arm. The first words spoken by
Queen Amélie and Queen Maria Pia, mother of Dom Carlos,
when they met, have been thus recorded: “They have
killed my son”—“And mine.” The murder was followed
in Lisbon by no wave of generous feeling, and if sadness was
felt by many it was in the words of Camões, an <i>apagada e vil
tristeza</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Republican Heroes.</div>

<p>Was this peculiarly hideous and dastardly crime the work
of the Republicans? They denied it at first for the sake of
foreign opinion, but subsequently they have
accepted it as one of the glorious deeds of
Portuguese history. Thousands of Republicans
defiled past the graves of the murderers, Buiça and Costa,
who had been cut down by the police, and the procession
to their graves has been continued on each anniversary of this
cowardly deed. The Democrats have now erected a costly
mausoleum in honour of its authors. On the first anniversary
of the Republic their names appeared written up in one of the
principal streets of Lisbon among the heroes of the nation.
Even while King Manoel was still on the throne Snr. João
Chagas addressed one of his <i>Cartas politicas</i> to the shade of
Manoel Buiça: “You did something great,” he says, “very
great. You rehabilitated, you dignified the people.” Yet
a people so “rehabilitated” could only be a despicable rabble.
It will be seen that the Republicans, or at least the Democrats,
have accepted and glory in this crime as their own. If at the
time they repudiated it for the sake of appearances (since it
was evident that a Republic ostensibly based on a deed of the
kind could have little chance of winning the sympathy of
foreign nations), in fact the Republican leaders and the
Lisbon shopkeepers who supported them gave it their hearty
approval, with that strange callousness which appears more
repulsive when combined with sentimentalism and vague<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
humanity. The more enlightened Republicans knew, of
course, that the King was not responsible for the dishonesty
or incapacity prevailing in Portuguese politics, and that his
interference in politics was strictly defined and limited by the
Constitution. There was no reason why honest and able men
should not rise to a prominent place in politics, and if the
Republicans held a monopoly of such men they would have
been well advised to reform the Monarchy from within, by
pocketing their Republicanism and rising to high office under
the Monarchy. The very fact that the King chose and stuck
to Snr. Franco in the face of all opposition shows that he was
far from being anxious to encourage corruption and
incompetence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Manoel’s Reign.</div>

<p>No sensible critic has accused Snr. Franco of either incompetence
or corruption. But the King’s death naturally
caused the fall of Snr. Franco, and the
Monarchy was left to attempt to carry out
reforms, but without the only politician disinterested
enough or of firm enough character to make the
attempt successful. The situation in the new reign, especially
during its last Ministry, with its sincere programme of reform,
was similar to that under Snr. Franco’s dictatorship, except
that the strong will had departed. The weakness and lenience
displayed towards the Republicans did not for a moment
disarm them; the reforms proposed only served to infuriate
them. It was considered that the strong hand had been tried
and failed, and an opposite policy was adopted. Almost the
new king might have been expected to go and lay a wreath
on the tombs of the assassins, so conciliatory was the Government.
The Republican leaders were released, the basest
insults and calumnies and active conspiracies were allowed
to go on unchecked. “Conspiracy proceeded on all sides”
(“<i>Conspiravase por toda a parte</i>”), says Snr. João Chagas,
and he ought to know. The Republicans looked forward to
a Portugal so different from that of the Monarchy that it
would scarcely be recognised. They had no reforms to offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
other than those advocated by the Royalists and they were
finally reduced to saying that what they wanted was—a
revolution. “Only a revolution could satisfy the thirst for
justice of Portuguese society: a revolution to punish the
crimes of the dictatorship and definitely expel the old politicians
from power.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But it was not yet too late for the
<i>velhos politicos</i> to stave off the revolution. Unhappily,
however, after the death of Dom Carlos they appeared in all
their worst faults, with no strong directing hand to restrain
them. Dom Manoel, thus at the age of eighteen suddenly
raised to the throne beyond all expectation, was in an extraordinarily
difficult position. His tastes inclined rather to
letters and music than to the art of government. He soon
found, moreover, that the party leaders were thinking not of
his interests, or the interests of Portugal, but of their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rotativism in Action.</div>

<p>The Ministers rose and fell at intervals of a few weeks. At
first Admiral Ferreira do Amaral formed a coalition ministry,
which naturally pleased nobody, while its
weakness towards the Republicans excited
criticism. Had the Republicans been as
unconnected with the murder of the King as for the sake of
appearances they at the time pretended, they would have been
the first to demand an instant and searching inquiry; as it
was, the government, in order to conciliate the Republicans,
allowed the investigations to be rather a matter of form than
anything else, and the exact truth will now never be established,
although the inference is clear. Admiral Ferreira
do Amaral was succeeded by Snr. Campos Henriques, who,
however, had the support of neither the <i>Vilhenistas</i> (Snr. Julio
de Vilhena had succeeded to the leadership of the <i>Regenerador</i>
party on the death of Snr. Hintze Ribeiro), nor of the <i>Progressistas</i>.
Snr. José Luciano de Castro, although himself in
retirement, continued to command the situation and pull the
political wires, occupying much the same <i>rôle</i> of Cabinet-maker
as Señor Montero Rios in Spain. Snr. Campos Henriques<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
was speedily succeeded in the Premiership by his War Minister,
Snr. Sebastião Telles, whose ministry did not last a month,
and who was in turn succeeded by the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the preceding Cabinet, Snr. Wenceslao de Lima.
Snr. Wenceslao de Lima occupied a somewhat similar position
to that of a Republican Premier, Dr. Bernardino Machado, four
years later. His Ministry was formed with the support of the
<i>Regeneradores</i> or <i>Vilhenistas</i> and the <i>Progressistas dissidentes</i>
or <i>Alpoimistas</i> (whose leader, Dr. José d’Alpoim, was the
personal enemy of the veteran Snr. José Luciano de Castro).
But he wished to please also Snr. Castro’s <i>Progressistas</i> by
maintaining the Civil Governors and Mayors appointed by
them. This is, of course, an all-important matter after the
constitution of a Portuguese Ministry, for as these officials
will make the elections it is a bone of contention to which
party they shall belong. The difficulty of a non-party
Ministry of Concentration or Coalition is to find a sufficient
number of non-party persons to fill these posts. In 1914
Snr. Bernardino Machado was accused of favouring the
officials of Dr. Affonso Costa as in 1909 Snr. Wenceslao de
Lima was accused of favouring those of Snr. Castro. And,
like the <i>Almeidistas</i> and <i>Camachistas</i> of the later day, the
<i>Alpoimistas</i> and <i>Vilhenistas</i> combined to overthrow the
Government. On 21st December (1909) a new Cabinet was
formed under Snr. Francisco Beirão. It lasted for six months.
It was a <i>Progressista</i> Ministry, and had to face the unflagging
opposition of both <i>Alpoimistas</i> and <i>Vilhenistas</i>, and of the
Republicans. No stone was left unturned to discredit the
Government. The sugar monopoly “scandal” was exploited
to the utmost, and Dr. Affonso Costa sought to implicate
persons of the Court in it. It seemed indeed that honesty was
only dear to Portuguese politicians when they were able to
unearth something damaging to their opponents. The
Ministry fell on the 19th of June, and after a crisis lasting a
fortnight Snr. Teixeira de Sousa agreed to form a <i>Regenerador</i>
Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Last Ministry of the Monarchy.</div>

<p>In the new Cabinet Snr. Anselmo de Andrade was Minister
of Finance and Dr. José de Azevedo Castello Branco Minister
for Foreign Affairs. It was this <i>Regenerador</i>,
or nominally Conservative, Government which
proposed reforms that should have satisfied
the most ardent reformers. They included
the alteration of certain clauses in the <i>Carta Constitucional</i>,
the reorganisation of the House of Peers, the reform of the
electoral law (allowing proportional representation to Lisbon
and Oporto) of the administrative code (re-establishing the
<i>juntas geraes</i> and so diminishing centralisation),<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of education,
of justice. It was proposed to make civil registration compulsory.
The contract between the State and the Bank of
Portugal was to be revised. Customs duties were to be paid
in gold.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Roads and irrigation were to receive especial
attention. Other measures were to affect the Army, the Navy,
the colonies. These are some of the reforms sketched in the
speech from the Throne read by King Manoel at the opening
of Parliament on the 23rd of September, 1910. Mere words?
But it only depended on the opponents of the Government to
translate some of them at least into reality. The Government
was only too willing but, apart from the opposition of the
Monarchical parties, the Republicans did not want reform—they
wanted a revolution. Had angels from Heaven drawn
up a programme of reforms the Republicans would still have
cried for a revolution. They did not allow Snr. Teixeira<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
de Sousa a breathing space to carry out some of these reforms
any more than they had allowed it to Snr. João Franco.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Republican Lisbon.</div>

<p>The elections had been held on 28th August, and resulted
in the return of 89 Ministerialists, 41 opposition <i>Bloquistas</i>,
and 14 Republicans. Ten of the latter were
returned by Lisbon (where the voting was
proportional). With 10,000 votes apiece,
the Eastern section of the capital returned Dr. Bernardino
Machado, Dr. Antonio José de Almeida, Dr. Affonso Costa,
Dr. Alfredo de Magalhães and Dr. Miguel Bombarda, and the
Western section Snr. João de Menezes, Admiral Candido dos
Reis, Dr. Theophilo Braga, Snr. Alexandre Braga and Snr.
Antonio Luis Gomes. The Government was in the seven
thousands in both districts, while the candidates of the
Monarchical Opposition <i>Bloco</i> received 5,000 votes apiece
in the <i>Circulo Occidental</i> and 2,000 in the <i>Circulo Oriental</i>.
The King, in obedience to the natural wishes of Queen Amélie,
had not left the Palace for some months after the assassination
of the 1st of February, 1908, but in the spring of that year
he opened Parliament in State, and read the Speech from the
Throne. In 1910 he was present at King Edward’s funeral,
and in the same year made a journey through the North of
Portugal, which in some districts became a triumphal progress,
the peasants pressing eagerly to welcome their King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Revolution of 1910.</div>

<p>After the opening of Parliament (which was then adjourned
till the end of the year), the King proceeded to Bussaco to
celebrate the anniversary of the battle in
which, on the 27th of September, 1810, Wellington
checked the advance of Masséna. The
Duke of Wellington was present (as also,
according to <i>O Seculo</i>, “Sir Olman, the historian”). The King
held a great military review. It is reported that the sentiments
of the Army towards the King were expressed in the words:
“They killed the other [Dom Carlos], but if they touch this
one they will have us to deal with.” A week later the
Republic had been proclaimed. On the 3rd of October,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
<i>O Seculo</i> in its weekly summary of events could write, “<i>Correu
serena a semana</i>—without anything worthy of mention.” On
that very day the Revolution was hastened by the act of a
madman, who shot one of the Republican deputies, Dr. Miguel
Bombarda. The crime was, of course, attributed to the
Royalists, but the Republicans have not shown that clemency
towards opponents which hushed up the details of King
Carlos’ murder, and had the death of Dr. Bombarda been due
to something more than the act of a single individual, the world
would have heard of it. Dr. Bombarda had earlier sat in
Parliament as a Royalist, but he had recently joined the
Republican party. On the 8th of August he had been the chief
organiser of an anti-clerical demonstration described as
“the greatest demonstration ever held in Lisbon,” and on the
28th of August was elected one of the ten Republican deputies
for Lisbon. The <i>Carbonarios</i> had been carefully organised, and
had done their work well, so that everything was prepared for a
revolutionary movement now or later. Mutinies had already
occurred on men-of-war, the marines having been won over
to very advanced views, and the loyalty of the First Artillery
and Sixteenth Infantry Regiments had been undermined.
These regiments, and marines from men-of-war in the Tagus,
under the command first of Admiral Candido dos Reis (who,
under the impression, it is said, that the movement was a
failure, committed suicide during the night of the 3rd), and
then of the <i>Carbonario</i> Lieutenant Machado Santos, were
able in a few hours to bring the Revolution to a successful
conclusion, in the face of the greater part of the Army, which
was loyal to the King: a signal example of the slowness and
apathy which have always permitted a handful of men of
energetic action to impose themselves temporarily in Portugal.
According to the Lisbon Press, the total casualties of the Revolution
were a little over 100 killed and 500 wounded. At eleven
o’clock on the morning of the 5th of October the Republic
was formally proclaimed at Lisbon, and Dr. Theophilo Braga
installed as President of the Provisional Government. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
provinces followed suit without a murmur. “If Lisbon turns
Turk to-morrow,” Eça de Queiroz had written, “all Portugal
will wear the turban.” Lisbon had now turned Turk, and the
three other towns of Portugal, Oporto, almost exclusively
Royalist, conservative Coimbra and clerical Braga, proceeded
to don the turban. The rest of the country docilely did as it
was bidden, and in its ignorance was as much affected by the
recent change from Monarchy to Republic as it has been by
recent changes of Ministry. The King had been entertaining
the President-Elect of the Brazilian Republic, Marshal Hermes
de Fonseca at dinner in the Necessidades Palace, on the evening
of the 3rd. During the night the fire from two men-of-war
in the river below was directed against the palace. Early on
the morning of the 4th the King, accompanied by a small
escort, left the palace, and subsequently embarked on the
Royal yacht at the little fishing village of Ericeira, to the
north of Cintra (the same which in the sixteenth century gave
its name, “King of Ericeira,” to one of the Sebastianist
impostors), with Queen Amélie, Queen Maria Pia, and his
uncle, the Duke of Oporto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Professionals and Professors.</div>

<p>The field lay open to the Republicans—professors who
dreamed that they would soon see their doctrines become
realities, professional politicians who had
waited long for their turn, <i>Carbonarios</i> who
had been skilfully trained as spies. The
<i>doctrinaires</i> were rapidly disillusioned, and
soon retired from active politics, leaving the more practical
politicians to go hand in hand with the <i>Carbonarios</i> if they
wished to maintain themselves in office. For the moment, amid
the Utopian dreams of a new Portugal, moderation prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhetoric.</div>

<p>On the 5th a proclamation was issued to the Portuguese
people, marked by that abstract and bombastic style which
disfigures the literary work of the President
of the Provisional Government: “The
maleficent dynasty of Bragança, wilful disturber
of social peace, has now been proscribed for ever....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
Now at length terminates the slavery of our country, and,
luminous in its virginal essence, rises the beneficent aspiration
of a <i>régime</i> of liberty.” The good <i>bourgeois</i> of Lisbon were
delighted. They felt that now at last they had a head of the
State who knew how to speak. A more practical proclamation
was that of the 7th to the effect that, “Since to-day there
can be no foolish attempts or hopes on the part of a <i>régime</i>
which has shamefully ended in a moral overthrow that adds
greater humiliation to the tremendous lesson taught it by the
Republican arms ... there is no reason for citizens to keep
in their possession the arms of which they made such heroic
use.” Throughout the country was posted up the decree
declaring the family of Bragança proscribed for ever, and the
orders of nobility extinct—bringing to many a village the first
inkling that such a thing as a revolution had occurred. In
Lisbon the Republicans had triumphed by sounding persistently
two notes, that of the <i>adeantamentos</i>, to prove that
the fall of the Monarchy would fill the Exchequer, that of
anti-clericalism, to show that the religious orders were
withholding the wealth of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Republican Promises.</div>

<p>Thus, apart from the dreams of the <i>doctrinaires</i>, the movement
was essentially materialistic, and what support the
Republicans had won in the country was
obtained by promises of cheaper food and
cheaper houses. Had the revolution been a
proof that the Portuguese nation was alive, it might have been
welcomed at whatever cost; but unfortunately it was the
outcome of the nation’s apathy, which gave a free hand to a
comparatively small body of politicians imbued with foreign
ideas. And had the Republicans been as practical as they
were materialistic, the Revolution might, again, have been
welcomed; but they looked rather to abstract principles—positivism,
liberty, humanity—than to the actual conditions
in Portugal. How materialistic was the creed of the Republicans
may be gathered from the following quotation from
<i>O Seculo</i> a few days after the Revolution: “The Court is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
wanted because with the exception of two or three noble
houses of large fortune, it consisted of persons without money....
The <i>bourgeoisie</i> is the safe of the nation, and it is nearly
all on the side of the Republic.” Rarely has franker expression
been given to the unmannerly creed that families in which
civilisation is a tradition of centuries, and which have often
done signal service to their country, should be cast aside if
they happen to be poor. How <i>naïf</i> was the Republican
idea of Monarchy is shown by the remark in the same leading
article of the same newspaper: “The man who presides
over the destinies of the nation is now no longer a man in high
boots and flowing robe with a little stick in his right hand;
he is a man dressed like any other.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humiliating Monarchy.</div>

<p>And the new President, Dr. Theophilo Braga, declared on the
15th of October that “Science tells us that monarchies have
no <i>raison d’être</i> because they humiliate the
men who accept them.” Thus in a brief
sentence all the nations of the North of
Europe are dismissed humiliated. It was a moment of
pardonable excitement, and some sincere Republicans believed
that a new era of peace and prosperity had dawned for
Portugal.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A Minority in Power.</div>

<p>It may have been hoped by many both in Portugal and
abroad that a new period of well-being for Portugal had begun.
It was known that the change had been
effected by a small section of Portuguese at
Lisbon, but there was apparently some
expectation that this small section would gradually extend
its influence until the Portuguese Republic and the Portuguese
people had indeed become one. It was believed, especially
outside of Portugal, that the corrupt and inefficient interplay
of party cliques at Lisbon was for ever at an end, and it was
also believed, especially in Portugal, that the magic of the
name Republic would restore prosperity to the national
finances. Better administration, the development of Portugal’s
resources, decentralisation, the improvement of conditions
in the colonies, these were some of the problems by which
the Republicans were confronted. Foreign opinion was
prepared to support a <i>régime</i> which should encourage all that
was best in the country, peasant and nobleman alike, to
co-operate in this huge effort of regeneration. A small
minority, of course, refused to co-operate, and the mass of the
people relapsed into indifference as it became apparent that
the Republicans, far from attracting waverers and conciliating
their opponents, intended to rule as one clique more rather
than as representatives of the Portuguese nation. The first
Parliament of the Republicans, packed with their supporters,
the municipal authorities appointed from Lisbon, the electoral
law delayed from session to session, the “invention” of the
clerical question, were so many indications of the gulf existing
between the Republic and the country, and that the
Republicans were aware of their isolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“Ordem e Trabalho.”</div>

<p>“<i>Ordem e Trabalho</i>”—“Order and Work” was the motto
chosen by the Republic, but with that Portuguese love of
words for their own sake or for the sake of
appearances, the legend was far removed
from the reality. On the very day after the
citizens of Lisbon had been requested to give up their arms
an assault was organised on the Convent of Quelhas. From
the windows or roof of the convent Jesuits were said to have
fired repeatedly on the mob, and to reconcile this assertion
with the fact that the convent when entered was found to be
empty, underground passages were devised for their escape,
although in reality such passages did not exist. A few days
later more firing was reported from the Jesuit convent at
Campolide, described by the Republican Press as a “fortress
of murderers and brigands.” In the next few months all the
offices of Royalist newspapers were attacked and wrecked,
both at Lisbon and in the provinces. At Coimbra and
elsewhere the Royalist and the Catholic Clubs were assaulted
and plundered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decrees.</div>

<p>Apart from the activity of the <i>Carbonarios</i>, the first months
of the Republic were marked by an almost equal number of
decrees and strikes. Every day the <i>Diario do
Governo</i> came out bursting with new decrees,
the Provisional Government being determined
to make hay before the slower procedure of Parliamentary
forms came to check progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strikes.</div>

<p>And nearly every day one or several classes of workmen,
taking advantage of the new permission to strike, struck.
The strikes were the reality, the decrees were
too often theoretical,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> although some of
them, such as that of agricultural credit,
2nd February, 1911, were excellent in principle. <i>O Seculo</i>
might speak with complacency of “the evident identification
of the people with the Government,” of “the close union<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
between the people and the Government,” but all these decrees
and the new Constitution provided by the Constituent Assembly
left the people cold. The salaries voted to themselves
by its representatives in Parliament did not fill it with enthusiasm:
it would have preferred cheaper <i>bacalhau</i>. The
<i>octroi</i> duty on certain articles was remitted, but it was soon
discovered that while the State lost several hundred <i>contos</i> the
price of the articles did not diminish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Constitution.</div>

<p>The people found but small compensation in the clauses of
the Constitution which declared that “The sovereignty belongs
essentially to the nation,” or “Members of
the Congress are representatives of the nation
and not of the clubs which elect them.” Each
Parliament was to last three years, and each year was to have
one session of four months, from 2nd December to 2nd April.
Parliament cannot be dissolved before the end of three years
(the result being that the frequent changes of government
are not even in appearance connected with the people).
Senators are elected for six years, half their number being
renewed at the elections to the Chamber of Deputies every
three years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">President Arriaga.</div>

<p>The President of the Republic must be of Portuguese
nationality and over thirty-five years of age. He is elected
for four years, and cannot be President twice
in succession.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> For the first term of the
Presidency (August, 1911, to August, 1915)
Dr. Manoel de Arriaga was elected.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Ten days after the election
of the President, Snr. João Chagas, since the Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Portuguese Minister in Paris, formed the first regular
Government of the Republic (3rd September, 1911).</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Royalist Incursion.</div>

<p>It did not last ten weeks; a period which included the first
Royalist incursion under Captain Paiva Conceiro. The
expedition was not of great importance. The
danger to the Republic lay in the possibility
of the whole of the North of Portugal rising
in favour of the Monarchy; but, although
there were many isolated disturbances they just failed to
break into a general conflagration. The organisation of
<i>Carbonario</i> spies throughout the country and the municipal
authorities appointed by the Republicans undoubtedly acted
as a powerful check on the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Snr. Chagas’ Ministerial Statement.</div>

<p>On the 4th of September Snr. Chagas had read his ministerial
statement to Parliament. His principal object, he
said, was to carry on the work begun by the
patriotic and disinterested members of the
Provisional Government, and his principal
care to reconcile the work initiated by them
with the situation of the Republic’s finances. The Republic
was to be a <i>régime</i> of conciliation for all Portuguese. Some
days later the Premier addressed a large crowd from a window
of the Ministerio of the Interior. That day, he said, was the
last of the revolutionary period, and began a period of order,
peace and work. Unfortunately it did nothing of the kind,
and Snr. Chagas was glad to get back to Paris.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Snr. Chagas’
promises had been too moderate to satisfy the extremists.
Reconciliation of all Portuguese was a large order for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Democrats who were never tired of demonstrating that a
Portuguese Royalist was far worse than an assassin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Augusto de Vasconcellos.</div>

<p>The new Ministry under the Premiership of Dr. Augusto
de Vasconcellos was presented to Parliament on the 16th of
November, 1911. Dr. Vasconcellos declared
that the Government would be decidedly anti-clerical.
He spoke of the urgent need of
adapting administration to the actual political condition of
the country, and of creating “an atmosphere of tranquillity,
peace, and confidence.” The Government received the support
of the leaders of the various tendencies of Republican
politics which had now crystallised into separate parties.
Dr. Affonso Costa, Dr. Antonio José de Almeida, and Dr. Brito
Camacho.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Yet all was not plain sailing for the Government.
Snr. Machado Santos even declared (<i>O Intransigente</i>, 8th
December, 1911) that every day that passed discontent
increased. And the <i>Seculo</i>, four days later, said: “Unless
Portuguese politicians leave little party questions on one
side, and devote themselves seriously to the economic development
of the country, the country is doomed.” “The Parliamentary
system has only served to embarrass for the most
part the normal life of the nation” (<i>O Seculo</i>, 12th December,
1911). The Budget, according to the same newspaper
(28th December, 1911) was “but a very close copy of those
of the Monarchy.” And while it was found impossible to
allow sufficient money for the most urgent expenses of schools
and roads, the Minister of Marine presented a project to
construct three 20,000 ton cruisers, twelve torpedo destroyers,
etc., at a total expense of 45,000 <i>contos</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh Disturbances.</div>

<p>At the end of January, 1912, a revolutionary strike at
Lisbon, coinciding with a widely extended strike movement
in Alemtejo, was met by the Government with the declaration
of martial law, and the arrest of over a thousand suspected
Syndicalists and workmen. It was during the weakness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
this and the following Government that the <i>Carbonarios</i>
were allowed to commit some of their worst outrages with
impunity. The “laws of defence” voted by
Parliament at the beginning of July on the
occasion of the second Royalist incursion were
opposed even by <i>O Seculo</i>, which remarked in a leading
article (6th July, 1912): “It is certain that we are thus
entering upon a purely arbitrary <i>régime</i> which will no doubt
be temporary but which nevertheless is a detestable instance
of the Parliament abdicating in favour of the Government,
of this and succeeding Governments.... The laws to which
we are referring are so vague and indefinite that they favour
any desire of persecution or vengeance.” Since the Royalist
“army” was as negligible as in the autumn of the preceding
year the excitement was deliberately fanned by the
<i>Carbonarios</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dom João d’Almeida.</div>

<p>It was during the second Royalist incursion in the summer
of 1912 that Dom João d’Almeida, a Portuguese of
noble family, serving as an officer in the
Austrian army, was taken prisoner. His
sentence of six years’ confinement in a solitary
cell in the <i>Penitenciaria</i>, to be followed by ten years of deportation
to a penal settlement, was severe, but under the circumstances,
naturally so. Unfortunately, however, for its credit,
the Republic neglected to treat him as an officer and a
gentleman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carbonario Outrages.</div>

<p>Persons known to be Royalist were set upon in the street,
beaten, wounded, and then arrested as conspirators. But
the worst feature was the encouragement
given by the Democrat Press to the perpetrators
of these outrages. The murder of
Lieutenant Soares elicited no protest from the Republican
Press. It was not till September that <i>A Republica</i>, organ of
the moderate Republicans, found its voice to protest generally
against the abuses: “The number of those who dislike or
distrust the Republic or have retired from politics is enormous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
owing to the narrow persecutions of the demagogues, headed
by Dr. Affonso Costa.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> On the 16th of June Snr. Duarte Leite
constituted another coalition government (Democrats, Evolutionists,
Unionists, Independents) in succession to that of
Dr. Augusto de Vasconcellos, who remained in office as
Minister for Foreign Affairs. Parliament met a little before
the date fixed by the Constitution, and the Government was
soon in crisis. Discontent was fairly general. An attempted
<i>coup d’état</i> by advanced Republicans had occurred at Oporto.
No municipal elections had been held since the Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Financial Situation.</div>

<p>The statement made to Parliament by the new Finance
Minister, Snr. Antonio Vicente Ferreira in November, concerning
the financial situation did not mend
matters. He admitted that the finances
were in a most serious state, and that the
deficit would be enormous. “As there can be no doubt,”
said <i>O Seculo</i> (4th December, 1912), “that waste is going on,
and indeed increasing precisely when it seemed that it should
have disappeared, the logical and irrefutable conclusion is:
The politicians of the Republic are personally as honest as
may be, but as administrators of the public finances they rank
with what was bad in the administration under the Monarchy.
Is this due to discreditable concessions? to weakness or
cowardice? We do not know.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Costa in Power.</div>

<p>The Government was <i>demissionario</i> before the end of the
year, and after a fortnight of attempts to constitute a moderate
Government, Dr. Affonso Costa was sent for
by the President and on the 9th of January
formed, with a ministry of nonentities, the
fifth government of the Republic.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This Democrat Ministry
maintained itself in office for a little over a year, and during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
that time some of the worst elements of the Republic were in
clover. <i>O Mundo</i>, under the editorship of Snr. França Borges,
now became an official organ, and made full use of its new
opportunities. In its inquisitorial ardour it spared not even the
impartial and moderate <i>Diario de Noticias</i> nor the distinguished
poet who was serving the Republic as its Minister in
Berne, Snr. Guerra Junqueiro, nor the President of the
Republic, nor any moderate person. The <i>Carbonarios</i>,
moreover, knew that whatever they did would be supported
by the Government, and the Government, by organising new
groups of <i>Carbonarios</i> in its special service, saw to it that
whatever they did should benefit the Democrat party. The
Democrats, the <i>Carbonarios</i> and the <i>Mundo</i> formed a trinity
which came very near to being as disastrous to the Republic
as, according to the Democrats, the “august trinity of Braganças,
Jesuits and English” had been disastrous to Portugal.
Dr. Costa, when Premier, declared that he agreed with every
word written in <i>O Mundo</i>. It is the creed of the Democrats
that outside the Republic there are no Portuguese, and outside
the Democrat party there are no Republicans. Those who do
not belong to the Democrat party can, therefore, scarcely be
good Republicans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombs and Risings.</div>

<p>Yet it became impossible in 1913 to continue to ascribe all
disturbances to the Royalists. The movements of April and
July of that year and the bomb thrown at the
procession in honour of Camões on the 10th of
June, killing and wounding several persons,
were the work of Anarchist and Radical Republican elements.
Yellow badges inscribed with the letters R.R. (<i>Republica
Radical</i>) were freely distributed, and the number of bombs
manufactured in Lisbon was so great that even the Republicans
who had exalted the bomb as the instrument of liberty, began
to like it less when it was directed against themselves. Well-intentioned
Republicans were exhorted to give up the bombs
in their possession, and after July hundreds of bombs were
thus daily delivered voluntarily or discovered by the police<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
in Lisbon. The <i>Mundo</i>, which continued to harp on the time-honoured
theme that the bomb-throwers were Jesuits, must
have failed to convince even the most enthusiastic of its
readers. Obviously from the point of view of the Republic,
Royalist conspiracies were far preferable to these plots and
disturbances within the very bosom of the Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crowded Prisons.</div>

<p>As early as February, 1913, on the day after Snr. Machado
Santos’ Amnesty Bill had been discussed in Parliament, the
<i>Alta Venda</i> of the <i>Carbonarios</i> had posted up
a notice in the streets of Lisbon, warning
citizens that the Royalists were actively
conspiring. Rigorous vigilance, said the notice, is needed;
all Portuguese worthy of the name must be at their posts to
destroy the miserable plots of the reactionaries. The warning,
subsequently explained Snr. Luz Almeida, head of the <i>Carbonarios</i>,
was dictated by fear of “the wave of false generosity
which was invading the spirit of sincere Republicans.” In
other words, there had been serious talk of an amnesty for the
political prisoners with which the prisons throughout the
country had been crowded since the proclamation of the
Republic. In December, 1912, the President addressed a
letter to the Government in favour of an amnesty for the
prisoners and the recall of the bishops. The Government
did not see its way to grant either, but in the following October,
on the third anniversary of the Republic, a pardon (<i>indulto</i>)
was given to some three hundred among the uneducated
prisoners of the <i>Penitenciarias</i>, who sought it as a favour. The
injustice was manifest, especially as it was not among the
uneducated classes that persons were most likely to have been
arrested and imprisoned merely for their Royalist opinions.
The “defenders of the Republic” did not intend the cells
thus vacant in the <i>Penitenciarias</i> to be left long unoccupied,
and they were to be filled by persons of higher social
importance than the released peasants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Movement of October, 1913.</div>

<p>The “Royalist movement” of October, 1913, was prepared
by means of <i>agents provocateurs</i>, with the object of making a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
clean sweep of all those suspected of being unfriendly to the
Republic who were not yet in prison. The most celebrated
of these agents, Homero de Lencastre, succeeded
in securing the arrest of the Conde
de Mangualde and other Royalists, and the
movement thus organised became a pretext for arresting Royalists
by the score. The proof of the existence of the Royalist
movement consisted chiefly in these arrests. The first and
last items on the programme of the “White Ants” and
<i>Carbonarios</i> were—arrests. The Lisbon police had not been
taken into the confidence of these unofficial defenders of the
Republic. In the words of the head of the Lisbon police
himself: “Neither the Minister of the Interior nor the Civil
Governor ever gave the Lisbon police any definite information
concerning the ‘conspiracy,’ with which the Oporto police,
it was said, was acquainted in all its details. Only vague
words: ‘A great affair,’ ‘we are on a volcano,’ ‘the men
are working bravely,’ and so forth. Certain indications
were received from the police at Oporto, but these indications
were very vague: ‘Many people compromised,’ ‘over four
hundred officers have signed documents with their own
blood,’ and so forth.” <i>Muita gente compromettida</i>: there in
three words is the <i>raison d’être</i> of the October “Royalist
conspiracy” which succeeded in overcrowding the prisons
throughout the country till the Amnesty Bill was passed in
the following February. Snr. Azevedo Coutinho almost alone
succeeded in escaping, on board an English boat, to the
extreme mortification of the <i>Carbonarios</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Partial Elections.</div>

<p>The partial election of members of the Chamber of Deputies,
rendered necessary by the vacancies due to deaths, resignations,
and diplomatic and other appointments,
were held on the 16th of November, and
resulted, as had been foreseen, in the return of
Democrats for all but two constituencies. Dr. Affonso Costa
thus had a good working majority in the Lower House, which
enabled him to dispense with the support of the Unionists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
by which he had been kept in office during the earlier part of
the year.</p>

</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Parliamentary Deadlock.</div>

<p>The majority in the Senate was, however, anti-Democrat.
Thus a difficult situation arose which in the beginning of the
following year led to a deadlock between the
Government and Parliament. A senator,
Snr. João de Freitas, had made certain
accusations against the Premier, Dr. Affonso Costa, and the
Premier, instead of attending in the Senate to refute the
charges, answered by a letter which the acting President of
the Senate considered lacking in respect to that House, and
therefore refused to read. The Government thereupon in its
turn refused to have anything to do with the sittings of the
Senate, and it therefore became impossible to carry through
certain necessary business such as the passing of the Budget.
At the same time the Government was threatened with
another general strike, and to avert this it adopted the old
method of surrounding the building in which the strikers
held their meetings and arresting hundreds of workmen. This
did not add to the popularity of the Government, which was
already hated owing to the arrest of hundreds of Republicans
after the April and July disturbances. The prisoners had
been sent partly to Elvas and partly to Angra do Heroisno,
since the prisons of the capital were insufficient. The Lisbon
Republican Press, which had kept silence concerning the
sufferings and ill-treatment of the Royalist prisoners and the
condition of the prisons, now told of the sufferings and ill-treatment
of the Republican prisoners, of the insanitary state
of the prisons, and the badness and insufficiency of the food.
A demonstration was actually held in Lisbon against the
Government of Dr. Affonso Costa, and a large crowd, organised
by Snr. Machado Santos, proceeded to the palace of Belem,
where the President of the Republic lives, to show their wish
for an amnesty, which the Democrat Government had declared
unnecessary and inopportune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">President Arriaga’s Letter.</div>

<p>It was evident that Dr. Costa’s days as Premier were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
numbered, and when the President addressed to him a letter
proposing that a government of concentration should be formed
in order to grant an amnesty, revise in a more
moderate sense the Law of Separation between
Church and State, pass the Budget and
hold the General Election, the Government
resigned (25th January, 1914). A crisis of over a fortnight
ensued. The Democrat Government had fallen because it
was in opposition to the President of the Republic, to the
majority in the Senate, and to public opinion. The President
had been on the point of resigning more than once during the
last two years as he saw his moderate policy ruthlessly cast
aside by the extremists. His definite resolution to resign
unless his conciliatory policy were now adopted, produced its
effect. But the Democrats still had a strong majority in
the Chamber of Deputies, which made it impossible for the
Evolutionists or Unionists to form a Ministry. The attempt
to constitute a non-party Government also failed. One of the
most significant features of the crisis was the extreme unwillingness
of the abler Republican politicians to take office.
It was not till the 9th of February that Snr. Bernardino
Machado was able to constitute a Cabinet, all the new
Ministers, with the exception of the Premier, holding office
for the first time. The Premier took the portfolio of Foreign
Affairs, as in 1910-11, and retained it during three months,
until Snr. Freire de Andrade was appointed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amnesty.</div>

<p>The Ministry came into power with the solemn obligation
of immediately introducing an amnesty to Parliament. Ten
days later (19th February) it redeemed this
promise, and after an all-night sitting the
Amnesty Bill was passed in the Chamber of
Deputies. The amendments made by the Senate were
rejected by the Lower House, and the Bill as voted by the
Chamber of Deputies became law on the 21st of February. The
terms of the Bill were unsatisfactory and gave rise to much
criticism, but its actual results were all that could be desired.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
All the political prisoners without exception were released,
and only eleven “leaders” or “instigators,” among the
thousands of prisoners and <i>émigrés</i>, were banished, for a space
of ten years. A less creditable clause was that by which all
abuses of authority were included in the amnesty. The clause
by which all the untried prisoners were to be tried subsequently
to their release received widespread criticism, and was
often misinterpreted, as was but natural considering its strange
and apparently contradictory character. For the law
expressly said that these persons even if sentenced to imprisonment
could not be imprisoned. Then why try them? it was
said. The reason apparently was to have an opportunity to
distinguish who were leaders or instigators, and also to show
that these persons had not been arrested unjustifiably. Another
point more justly criticised was the indefinite power conferred
by the law to banish leaders and instigators. Only eleven
persons, however, were regarded as leaders, and not allowed to
return to Portugal, whereas it was calculated that the amnesty
would include some 3,000 persons, of whom 572 were untried
prisoners and 1,700 <i>émigrés</i>. The new Government was obliged
to walk circumspectly, for although it leaned towards the
Democrats and consulted the wishes of Dr. Affonso Costa, it
did not content the extremists of that party, and it contented
scarcely anyone else. It did not profess to look upon itself
as more than a stop-gap ministry, temporarily pouring oil
on the troubled waters between a storm and a storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seventh Republican Government.</div>

<p>It was succeeded by a Democrat ministry, presided over by
Snr. Victor Hugo d’Azevedo, Democrat President of the
Chamber of Deputies. Regardless of the
fact that a great World War was now raging,
the thoughts of political parties were bent
almost exclusively upon the forthcoming
elections. The real reason for the fall of Dr. Bernardino
Machado’s Government was that the Democrats were determined
to run no risks and to make the elections themselves.
For this it was essential to have a Democrat at the Ministry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
of the Interior, and Dr. Alexandre Braga, considered to have
much skill in the political intrigues required, was accordingly
appointed Minister of the Interior. Everything seemed to
point to an overwhelming return of Democrats at the election.
Press, Opposition, public opinion were gagged, telegrams to
the foreign Press suppressed. “Ministerial oppression,” said
General Pimenta de Castro, “reached such a point that even
liberty of thought was strangled.” A packed Democrat
Parliament seemed assured. But there were two elements
which proved too vigorous to be gagged and bound. One of
these was the bitter discontent of the other political parties
who saw the elections escaping them; the other was discontent
in the Army. When the Democrat Government proceeded
to interfere with the Army and, moreover, attempted
to hamper the President of the Republic’s action, and to force
him into declaring martial law, the cup brimmed over, and a
military <i>pronunciamento</i> led to the fall of the Ministry and to
the appointment of General Pimenta de Castro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pimenta de Castro.</div>

<p>The Democrats still had a majority in the Chamber of
Deputies, but, when they attempted to meet and “confer of
their miserable fall,” like Satan and his angels
on the burning lake, they found the entrance
of the Congresso guarded against them. The
country had had enough of their constitutional hypocrisies.
From thenceforward General Pimenta de Castro’s Government,
welcome to the country, went serenely on its way,
although bitterly attacked by the Democrat opposition which
even went to the length of spreading abroad in their Press
that the Government was responsible for the rise in prices,
although it was well known—to all but the ignorant readers
of such newspapers—that the pinch of the war would be felt
in the Spring. The President of the Republic also came in
for his share of foul abuse, owing to the fact that by the
firmness and strength of character displayed by him the
election hopes of the Democrat party had been ruined. It
may well be argued that his action also saved the Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
since it is difficult to believe that the Republic could have
lasted many months longer in the rarefied atmosphere produced
by the Democrats in power. There was a general
breath of relief throughout the country, and by an odd
paradox this new Government born of a military movement,
this “dictatorship,” this “tyranny,” proved the most
moderate Government that Portugal had seen since the
Revolution of 1910. With equal moderation and firmness
one measure after another was enacted in order to bring about
the long-dreamt reconciliation of all Portuguese. Churches
were restored to the use of the faithful, officials arbitrarily
dismissed were restored to their posts, the “White Ants”
were sent about their business, their so-called “Committee of
Public Safety” abolished, and finally in April (1915) a general
amnesty emptied the prisons and allowed the eleven exiles
of the 1914 amnesty to return to Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moderate Dictator and Constitutional Tyrants.</div>

<p>O but, say the Democrats, it was all so unconstitutional!
Such a dictatorship! <i>Of course</i> it was unconstitutional.
The Constitution has been so ordered that the
Democrats having installed themselves in
power—and they had been in power in fact
if not in name since the Revolution—could
never be dislodged by constitutional means.
Their majority in the Chamber of Deputies was secure, their
majorities in the town councils throughout the country, and
in the officials responsible for returning the new deputies
equally secure. It became necessary to dissolve these bodies,
by force if they would not go willingly. But the country
which had suffered from four years of constitutional tyranny
was delighted to have a little unconstitutional moderation.
In vain the Democrats cried out that it was a dictatorship
worse than the dictatorship of Snr. João Franco. If, answered
common-sense opinion, the Government which empties the
prisons, maintains order and acts in every respect so fairly
and moderately, is a dictatorship, then may all succeeding
Governments be tarred with the dictatorial brush. Only so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
will the future of the Republic and of Portugal be secure.
It is quite true that the situation in some respects resembled
that of Snr. João Franco’s Government, and it is a striking
and bitter comment on the seven intervening years that to
find a government as good as that of General Pimenta de
Castro one has to go back to that of Snr. João Franco. They
are like two rocks, and the seven years between a sea of slush
and molten fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolution of May, 1915.</div>

<p>Scarcely had these words been written when the guns of the
fleet early on the 14th of May announced the determination of
Democrats and <i>Carbonarios</i>, having found no
support in public opinion, to overthrow by
force the Government of General Pimenta de
Castro. For two days Lisbon was cut off from the outside
world and bombarded from the river. Scores of persons
lost their lives, hundreds were wounded. The rebels
triumphed. General Pimenta de Castro was arrested. The
Democrat Press had done its work well. The sergeants in
the army had been encouraged to mutiny against their
superior officers, and the officers who resisted the mutiny
of the sailors were arrested or killed. The commander of the
<i>Vasco da Gama</i> was shot dead, the commander of the <i>Almirante
Reis</i> died some days later of his wound. The Democrat
revolutionary committee nominated a new government with
Snr. João Chagas as Premier. The new Premier was, however,
shot by the Senator João de Freitas when on his way to
Lisbon, and, although not mortally wounded, resigned the
premiership some days later. This was the only <i>contretemps</i>
in the Democrats’ plans. Otherwise their victory was complete,
and they at once set about making the elections. In
certain States of South America one has heard of such proceedings,
of a party winning its way to power by means of
civil war. (The peaceful and exceptionally well-governed
country of Chile, ignorantly confused with the pungent red
Chili pepper of the Portuguese Republic, naturally resented
any such comparison.) But even over those States the World<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
War had thrown a steadying influence. That a party
in Portugal should take this opportunity to copy Mexico
stamps that party more effectively than would reams
of comment. It suffices to state the fact, and the
Democrat party will always be known as the party which,
under cover of the World War, raised itself to power over the
dead bodies of its fellow-countrymen. The object of the
Revolution of the 14th of May, say the Democrats, was to restore
the Constitution. The falseness of this argument will be
obvious to any but the wilfully obtuse when it is remembered
that the general election was fixed for the 6th of June, and
that they would therefore in twenty days have had constitution
to their hearts’ content. As a result of their proceedings, Dr.
Arriaga, the moderate President of the Republic, resigned,
accompanying his resignation with a very dignified protest
addressed to Parliament. The Democrat members of Parliament
thereupon chose the Democrat, Dr. Theophilo Braga, to
succeed him (29th May, 1915). General Pimenta de Castro was
deported to the Azores and dismissed from the Army. Were
not the injustice of it a bitter shame and humiliation to all
true Portuguese, this persecution as dictators and tyrants of
two old men who have been Liberals and Republicans for over
a generation, and have done and suffered so much for the
Republic (but not for the <i>Carbonario</i>-Democrat clique) would
be highly diverting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient Allies.</div>

<p>The case of Great Britain and Portugal is the only instance
in history of an alliance extending over seven centuries.
With two peoples so fundamentally different
such an alliance could not prevent misunderstandings,
but it has nevertheless been a real
bond. It is characteristic of Portugal’s whole history that
England, separated from her by a great expanse of sea, should
have been a nearer neighbour than Spain, and although
it has sometimes become the custom in Portugal for writers
and speakers to belittle England on every possible occasion,
there has never been any real or at least immediate thought
of giving up the ancient alliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spain and Portugal.</div>

<p>The modern Portuguese are full of suspicions with regard
to foreign politics, and are unwise enough to give these
suspicions expression in words. Recently
the well-known Madrid newspaper, <i>La Epoca</i>,
officially denied that these <i>suspicacias portuguesas</i>
had any foundation in fact: “For some time
past there has been talk in Portugal of the so-called ‘Spanish
danger,’ and the Press of that country of various political
shades frequently declares that intervention in Portugal
meets with widespread favour in Spain.... In Spain
no thought has ever been given to the political form of the
Portuguese Government further than the wish for order
and tranquillity in the neighbouring nation, since these
constitute the sure basis of prosperity. This we sincerely
desire, as it is desired by all the powers that have
relations of real friendship with Portugal.... Whatever
the form of Government in Portugal we repeat that the
Press and public opinion in Spain unfortunately give but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
slight and disconnected attention to the affairs of that country,
and that there is no reason whatever for these suspicions,
since we only occupy ourselves with Portugal in order to wish
her every kind of happiness.” A <i>démenti</i> somewhat crushing
in its kindness, invoked by the mania of the Portuguese to
ascribe motives that do not exist. The expression of such
suspicions can be of no possible advantage to Portugal.
The weakness of Portugal’s army and of her defences, and the
practical non-existence of her navy are perfectly well known,
and Spain could easily conquer Portugal were she so minded.
The difficulty would be to retain her conquest. All the
Portuguese in their hatred of the Spaniard and their love of
independence would unite to throw off the yoke of Spain,
even though they have not the sense to unite to build up
Portugal’s prosperity and to make a second imposition of the
Spanish yoke impossible. Spain would thus be confronted
with that which defeated Napoleon—the resistance of a people,
and might come out of the conflict shorn of Catalonia as well
as of their new Lusitanian province. The country that would
benefit would be Portugal, since the Portuguese would at last
pull themselves together and pull together. But indeed the
idea of Spain permanently conquering Portugal is as far
removed from practical politics as the idea cherished by not
a few Portuguese—of Portugal conquering Spain. Iberian
unity may be a pleasant dream, but when a country has won
for itself so definite and distinguished a position as Portugal in
history, literature and language, it is too late for it to coalesce
with another nation, unless as one of a federation of free States,
the Basque Provinces and Asturias, Portugal and Galicia,
Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia, Andalucía, Castille. Nor can
one think of Lisbon as a provincial capital. Portugal, modern
and progressive, considers Spain very backward and narrow,
and rarely seeks to pierce the rough shell to the very excellent
kernel beneath it. The Portuguese Press, which gives to
foreign news infinitely greater and more enlightened attention
than does the Press of Spain, scarcely extends its interest to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Spain. And unfortunately what <i>La Epoca</i> said is true:
Spain gives Portugal but a passing thought. Both countries
would be the gainers by closer relations and a better understanding.
Portugal is far more nearly allied in thought with
France than with Spain, and the Portuguese who takes the
<i>Sud-Express</i> from Lisbon to Paris journeys through an
unknown country till he reaches the French frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Republicans and the British Alliance.</div>

<p>Formal ally Portugal possesses but one in Europe: Great
Britain. The Portuguese, especially the Portuguese Republicans,
have attacked this alliance vigorously;
indeed, the Republican party increased and
prospered largely as a protest against Lord
Salisbury’s ultimatum. Even as late as 1910
a book appeared,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> which accused the English
of being in their relations to Portugal hypocritical, voracious
and untrustworthy. Snr. João Chagas in one of his pamphlets
had charged the Kings of the Braganza dynasty with
being “vassals of England,” and this book was the “arraignment
of the Monarchy in Portugal.” The British Alliance,
it said, was essentially an alliance between dynasties, and
to this character owed its unbroken continuity “in spite of
all the incidents that have arisen between the two countries
and of the unequivocal feeling of repulsion which separates
the two peoples.” England has “exploited and insulted us.”
But, asks the writer, “does the protection of England at least
shelter us from other countries?” and his answer is “Only
if it suits her interests. The decadence and degradation of
Portugal are due to the august trinity of the Braganças, the
Jesuits and the English.” British policy towards Portugal
has “always been inspired by a spirit of rapine.” The British
alliance has been constantly characterised by its want of
sincerity and “a spirit absolutely foreign to the general interests
of the Portuguese nation.” And after heaping abuse
and insult the author concludes that, much as Portugal may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
dislike the British alliance, “it is that which suits Portugal
more than any other,” since Great Britain is the only power
which can effectively support Portugal against the encroachment
of Germany and the Congo Free State. They cannot
have their cake and eat their cake, and if they wished the
British alliance to continue why express their hatred and
abhorrence of it? This book was the true expression of the
attitude of the Portuguese Republicans towards England,
although Dr. Bernardino Machado, first Republican Minister
for Foreign Affairs and fifth Republican Premier, who supplied
it with an introduction and with a prefatory letter, dated
20th May, 1910, held no official position when he expressed
cordial approval of its contents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germany’s Peaceful Penetration.</div>

<p>The Republicans after the Revolution were obliged to
modify their attitude, but it would have been wiser had they
frankly accepted the British Alliance, frankly
without <i>arrière-pensée</i>, instead of exerting
themselves to stand well with Great Britain
officially while at the same time indulging in
petty slights and insinuations, and doing their utmost to
encourage German at the expense of British trade in Portugal.
German exports to Portugal before the War, although they
had not yet equalled the British, were gaining ground very
rapidly (<i>avance à pas de géants</i>, said M. Marvaud). Intellectually
France held the field, materially it might soon be Germany.
The British Chamber of Commerce in Portugal,
founded in 1911, does good service in the interests of British
trade. The threatened increase of the already exorbitant
Customs duties has had at least the good effect of bringing
about several commercial treaties: between Portugal and
Germany (1908), Portugal and Great Britain (1914), and others,
<i>e.g.</i>, with Spain, are in contemplation. It was certainly
significant and, partly, the natural outcome of the commercial
treaty of 1908, that the Lisbon shopkeepers, the most devoted
of the Republic’s supporters, filled their shops as never
before with German wares. Germany methodically set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
herself to undermine the British Alliance by peaceful penetration.
She offered Portuguese tradesmen cheaper (if less
lasting) goods than did Great Britain, and made great reductions
for large orders, and generally studied and consulted
the needs and the character of her Portuguese customers.
Her advances were so well received as to give a misleading
impression. A German observer, Dr. Gustav Diercks, for
instance, writing in 1911, guilelessly remarked that Germans
were perhaps of all foreigners, the most agreeable to the
Portuguese at the present time, “because they have nothing
to fear from them, and have learnt to know them merely as
pleasant business men, whose aim is not the systematic
exploitation of Portugal.” For the great majority of Portuguese,
of course, tradition counts for less than nothing; and
the old Portuguese families, with which tradition counts for
much, often have old ties of family or religion connecting
them with Germany or Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspicion and Distrust.</div>

<p>The chief evil in Portugal has been the imagination of evil,
the fear of disease doing much to encourage or aggravate the
disease. The suspicions of conspiracy were
more serious than the actual conspiracies,
the continual charges of political corruption
are a powerful incentive to political corruption. The nagging
accusations against Spain at the time of the Royalist incursions
might have tempted that country to help the Royalists in
earnest. The ridicule and abuse heaped in an underhand way
on Great Britain might have induced a Power without scruples
and without a sense of honour to make serious use of its brute
force. It would, of course, be quite as easy for Great Britain
to pocket the entire colonial empire of Portugal as it was for
Germany to invade Belgium. But even the most suspicious
and cantankerous Portuguese trusts Great Britain’s honour
and moderation; and if the Republicans have sometimes
affected to regard Great Britain as a gorged beast of prey,
they trust and love Germany much as one may love and trust
a tiger ready to spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">English and Portuguese in the Twelfth Century.</div>

<p>For those to whom history and tradition have any meaning,
the ancient alliance between Great Britain and Portugal and
the fact that under many diverse conditions
Englishmen and Portuguese have fought side
by side, will always establish at least a basis
of friendliness between the two countries.
Before Portugal was Portugal, Portuguese
and English fought in a common undertaking, the conquest
of Lisbon from the Moors in 1147. In this difficult enterprise
English crusaders played a very important part, and an
account of it was written, in Latin, by an Englishman. A
treaty between Portugal and England, or at least between
Portuguese and English merchants, followed not long afterwards,
for in 1308 when the treaty was formally renewed
by the Kings of England and Portugal, King Edward wrote
to King Diniz of “the treaty of love and union that has
hitherto existed between your merchants (<i>mercatores</i>) and
ours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Aljubarrota.</div>

<p>It was, however, in the fourteenth century that the old
treaty between the countries became a definite and strong
alliance. Portugal was in need of a foreign
ally against her neighbour Castille, and when
old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,
laid claim to the throne of Castille, a further tightening of the
relations between England and Portugal indicated itself as
the obvious policy. A treaty between John of Gaunt and
King Ferdinand of Portugal was drawn up at Braga in 1372.
It is true that eight months later Ferdinand signed a treaty
of peace with King Henry II of Castille against the Duke of
Lancaster and the King of England, but England continued
to have many friends and partisans at the Portuguese Court,
and eight years later, when Portugal was again at war with
Spain, an English fleet with three thousand soldiers commanded
by the Earl of Cambridge (<i>Cambris</i> and <i>Cãbrix</i> in the old
Portuguese chronicles) appeared in the Tagus to the assistance
of Portugal. Unhappily the English soldiers incurred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
hatred of the inhabitants by their pillaging and lawless behaviour,
as if they were in a hostile country. They remained in
Portugal till 1383 when a fresh treaty between the Kings of
Castille and Portugal turned the tables on them, and the
King of Castille blandly provided ships to convey them back
to England. However that might be, King Ferdinand’s
successor, the Infante João, Master of Aviz, when he laid claim
to the crown of Portugal, was glad enough to be able to count
on the support of England, and the prosperity of his reign
certainly owed something to English influence. English
soldiers fought side by side with the Portuguese in the victory
of Aljubarrota in 1385, and the great Nun’ Alvares evidently
learnt from English soldiers the best way of making his infantry
effective against cavalry. At Aljubarrota, as at Crécy and
Agincourt, the infantry stood firm in close formation against
vastly superior numbers, and all the efforts of the cavalry
were as powerless to break them as were the French charges
at Waterloo. The influence of the Earl of Cambridge and the
other English commanders was great in Portugal, and when
João I married an English princess in 1387, English ascendancy
became supreme at the Portuguese Court. There are many
indications to show how wide that influence extended. The
dignity of Constable and Marshal were introduced directly
from England; Nun’ Alvares, the first Constable, was deliberately
a second Galahad; the chivalry of the Round Table
became the incentive and fashion of the Portuguese courtiers
and nobles; the royal princes were given an English education
by their English mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Philippa.</div>

<p>To her Portugal owes a great debt. The Portuguese
chronicles admit that her children received a more careful
education than was habitual at the Courts
of the Peninsula, and one of these children was
Prince Henry the Navigator, real founder of
Portugal’s glory in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
The treaty of 1308 between Portugal and England had been
constantly renewed: in 1353, 1372, and 1380. After King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
João I’s accession it was confirmed in 1386 and 1404. The
fishermen and traders of Portugal, as indeed of the whole
coast as far as Bayonne, had much in common both in character
and interests with the English, and even if close relations
had not existed between the Courts of Portugal and
England it is probable that some such treaty would have been
formed as existed between Basque fishermen and King
Edward II of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alliance Broken Off and Renewed.</div>

<p>In 1470 these friendly relations were disturbed. Portuguese
ships were plundered by English pirates. But actual war was
avoided, and the treaty signed in 1472 lasted
unbroken between Portugal and England for
the next hundred years. In 1580, when Portugal
came under Spanish sway, her alliance
with England naturally fell to the ground, and it was actually
in the harbour of the Tagus that was equipped the greater
part of the Invincible Armada of 1588. Portugal, which
had sometimes found England’s friendship unpleasant, when
English soldiers were quartered for long periods in Portugal,
and, as says an old chronicle, would kill an ox in order to eat
its tongue, now experienced the very much more unpleasant
consequences of the cessation of that friendship. All her
coasts and all her colonies were at the mercy of her former
ally’s attacks. As soon as the yoke of Spain was thrown off
the Duke of Bragança as João IV sent ambassadors to England
to conclude peace. A treaty was signed in January, 1643,
by which many mutual privileges, both of trade and
individuals, were recognised. Among other privileges of
British subjects in Portugal, it was agreed that British Consuls
need not belong to the Roman Catholic religion. Generally
the treaty increased in a high degree the facilities of trade
and commerce between the two countries. But when Cromwell
came to the throne the relations between England and
Portugal were not easy, in spite of the fact that they had the
same enemies. In 1650, Prince Rupert and his brother
Maurice took refuge in Portugal, and King João IV refused to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
accede to Cromwell’s demand that they should be surrendered.
Two years later, however, when both Portugal and England
were at war with the Dutch, the old friendship was resumed.
The Conde de Penaguião was sent on a special mission to
England, and in July, 1654, the treaty of 1642 was revised and
renewed. Among other articles it stipulated that the English
should have certain rights of trading with the Portuguese
possessions in the East, and that in Portugal no British subject
might be arrested without a special warrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Ameixial.</div>

<p>The Restoration in England and the marriage of Charles II
with Catharina, daughter of King João IV, drew the bond
between Portugal and England still closer.
In 1662 an English force was sent to Portugal
to assist her in her war against Spain, and
in the following year took part in the victory over Don John
of Austria at Ameixial. The Spanish losses in dead, wounded,
and prisoners are said to have numbered 10,000 out of a total
army of 16,000. The Portuguese losses are given as 1,500
dead and wounded, and those of their allies, the French and
the English, as 300 and 50 respectively. Once more, as at
Aljubarrota and so many other fights, the English had contributed
in some measure to secure Portugal’s independence.
Charles II also helped to bring about the peace between
Spain and Portugal, which was signed after many negotiations
and difficulties in 1668. The English ambassadors both at
Madrid and Lisbon worked persistently for peace, and the
two neighbouring countries, which should never have been
at war, were finally induced to accept it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Catharine’s Dowry.</div>

<p>A new treaty between England and Portugal had been
signed seven years earlier in 1661, by which all the older
treaties were confirmed. Portugal ceded
Tangiers to Great Britain, as well as Bombay,
and two million <i>cruzados</i> as dowry of the
Princess Catharine. Great Britain promised
to protect Portugal by land and sea, with cavalry, infantry,
and ten of her best warships whenever Portugal might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
attacked. Great Britain, moreover, undertook never to
form a treaty with Spain which might be in any way prejudicial
to Portuguese interests, never to give back Dunkirk or
Jamaica to Spain, and to support the Portuguese in India
against the Dutch unless the latter made peace with Portugal.
At first sight the actual advantages of this treaty are all on the
side of Great Britain, those of Portugal being chiefly hypothetical,
but Portugal had received in the past proofs of support
from England so solid that the promise of British support in
the future was considered as anything but nugatory. After
the Revolution in England William of Orange informed the
King of Portugal of his intention to abide by the existing
treaties, and accordingly King Pedro II gave no help to the
exiled Stuarts, however much they might have his sympathy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War of the Spanish Succession.</div>

<p>In the war of the Spanish Succession Portugal at first maintained
neutrality in spite of the offer of ships and men made
to her by the Allies if she declared war against
Spain, and the promise that whatever territory
she won from Spain should be guaranteed
to her after the war ended. Although Portugal’s
duty and interests alike seemed to require that she
should join the alliance against Spain without hesitation, it
was not till May, 1703, that she finally threw in her lot with
them. The alliance between Great Britain and Portugal
has more than once shown a strange capacity to simmer
down into neutrality at the very moment when it might have
been expected to be most active. Yet war between Great
Britain and another Power was not so remote a contingency
that Portugal’s attitude and obligations might not have been
clearly defined beforehand. Of the force of 28,000 men which
Portugal now engaged to bring into the field, nearly a half,
13,000, were to be maintained by the Allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Methuen Treaty.</div>

<p>The Methuen commercial treaty between Great Britain
and Portugal was signed in the same year (27th December,
1703). On the strength of this treaty. Great Britain has been
accused, and is still sometimes accused, of deliberately planning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Portugal’s ruin, as if Great Britain were to blame because her
woollen goods were superior to those of Portuguese manufacture,
or because the Portuguese, in a short-sighted
desire for immediate profits, planted
more than a due proportion of their land with
vines, till wine became commoner than water, while agriculture
and pasture lands were neglected. But it is certain that
the neglect and lack of enterprise of the Portuguese allowed
a great part of Portuguese trade to fall into the hands of the
English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pombal’s Attitude towards England.</div>

<p>The Marquez de Pombal, who lived in England as Portuguese
Ambassador for six years, was able to compare England’s
active business methods with the lazy <i>laisser-aller</i>
of the Portuguese. England, he said,
has become master of the whole of Portugal’s
trade. But however much he might deplore
and seek to remedy this fact, he recognised
that the British alliance must be the basis of all Portugal’s
foreign policy. England and Portugal, he said, were like
man and wife: they might quarrel, but, if a third party
interfered, they would unite against the common foe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peninsular War.</div>

<p>In 1805 the threats of Napoleon induced Portugal to declare
war formally against England and to close her harbours to
British ships. Three hundred English families,
settled in business in Portugal, left the
country. Great Britain was willing to accept
these measures as the results of a necessity
that knew no law, and although war was formally declared,
the British Ambassador, Lord Strangford, remained at
Lisbon. But when Portugal went still further, and at the
bidding of France confiscated the property of those English
families that had remained, Lord Strangford demanded his
passports, and an English fleet blockaded the mouth of the
Tagus. Before the British Ambassador could leave the country
Junot had approached rapidly nearer to Lisbon. When
Strangford received the <i>Moniteur</i> in which it was announced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
that “the House of Braganza has ceased to reign,” he was
able to induce the Prince Regent to sail for Brazil. Portugal’s
lot was now once more closely united with that of Great
Britain. The Peninsular War, in which Portuguese and
English troops fought side by side on many a field, could not
fail to strengthen the old alliance, however much individual
differences of character might come to the surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Allies and Strangers.</div>

<p>Yet, after seven centuries of constant intercourse between
English and Portuguese, it is indeed astonishing that in
intellectual and social relations they should
have remained almost strangers. The blame
for this disappointing fact may be equally
apportioned between them. Certainly England cannot be
acquitted of a certain narrowness and angularity—whether it
be the result of stupidity or pride—which has driven Portugal,
intellectually, into the hands of France or Germany. It is
to be regretted, in this respect, that the Commercial Treaty
between Portugal and Great Britain negotiated by Sir Arthur
Hardinge and Mr. Lancelot Carnegie, and signed in 1914,
should not have included a clause by which English books
might share the favourable treatment as regards Customs
duties which is given to French books. A knowledge of
English literature would do much to increase the regard or
diminish the dislike of the Portuguese towards England.
Latin nations give more importance to literature than is
perhaps attributed to it in England, and the fact that Portuguese
literature and Portuguese history meet with little
sympathy or study in England undoubtedly has its effect in
Portugal when it is compared with the attitude of Germany.
The difference leaps to the eyes of all educated persons in
Portugal, and it must not be forgotten that in Portugal the
uneducated people—apart from the trained demagogues’
bands in the cities—has no part or parcel in the affairs of the
nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German Ascendancy.</div>

<p>If you ask what is the best history of Portugal, the answer
is that of Heinrich Schaefer, a German; there is not even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
an English translation of it, although a considerable portion
of it is English history. English readers must read this in
German or in the French translation. If you
inquire for the best history of Portuguese
literature, if you wish to consult important
works on the Portuguese language, if you wish to read all the
works of Portugal’s chief poet in a translation, the language
necessary for your purpose is still not English, but German.
It is not a creditable fact, for England, and it may be that one
result of the World War will be to broaden England’s outlook:
if so, it is to be hoped that she will, especially, bestow more
attention on the life and character, literature, and history
of the oldest of her allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese Finance.</div>

<p>To find Portuguese finances in a satisfactory, above all, in a
natural, condition, it is perhaps necessary to go back to the
days of King Diniz, who, after spending
much on the development of the country,
left a full treasury at his death in 1325. The
succeeding kings maintained this prosperity, but at the end
of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries the
great change came which has made Portuguese finance the
most artificial in Europe. Precious stones and metals and
spices from the East took the place of money derived from
patient industry and the toil of men’s hands. Agriculture,
which has always been Portugal’s principal industry, was
neglected, and the fields lay desolate. The peasants willingly
in a spirit of adventure, or eager to exchange assured misery
for an uncertainty, or forcibly enlisted, were shipped off to the
Indies. The great majority of them never saw Portugal
again: disease, battle, and shipwreck having done their work
well. The eyes of all in the country became fastened upon
Lisbon, but the wealth arriving at Lisbon rarely filtered into
the provinces; far more frequently it was employed in purchasing
articles of luxury from abroad. It is the situation of
the present day, Lisbon importing motor-cars by the score
and innumerable luxuries, while the country remains undeveloped
and poverty-stricken. After the gold from India
came the discovery of gold in Brazil, a later possession of
Portugal, and even to-day, when Brazil is a separate State,
the money coming to Portugal from rich Portuguese <i>brazileiros</i>
props up a system which, on the failure of this last resource,
is in danger of falling with a crash, as indeed it fell in 1892.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Direitos de Alfandega.</div>

<p>The Customs duties constitute about a third of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
revenue, and the system of excessive protection enables
Ministers of Finance to live from year to year, but it may be
described as a system which fills the Exchequer
and ruins the country. It is maintained
for the simple reason that it does enable
the Government to avoid bankruptcy, and it is excused as
encouraging Portuguese industries. But in a country almost
exclusively agricultural as is Portugal, protection should be
of a very moderate kind. The most extreme protection cannot
make Portuguese industries flourish and it seriously injures
agriculture. Because agricultural machines and other implements
imported from abroad are comparatively lightly taxed
(from 5 to 60 <i>réis</i> per kilo), it is imagined that agriculture
does not suffer from a system which sends up the general cost
of living to an abnormal degree! It may be of interest to
give some examples of the Customs tariff. Motor-cars are
taxed 120,000 <i>réis</i> (20 <i>réis</i> roughly = one penny), motor
cycles 50,000, pianos 50,000, silk articles up to 13,500 per kilo,
woollen articles up to 3,500 per kilo, cotton articles up to
1,600 per kilo, a kilo of tobacco 4,500, men’s hats 900 each,
a kilo of biscuits 120, of sugar 120 and 145, of tea 1,000,
chocolate 200, jam 200, honey 35, cheese 300, butter 250.
Horses pay from 24,500 to 32,500 each, donkeys 2,500, mules
14,500, goats 500, sheep 500, pigs 3,600, cows 7,500. Dynamite
is taxed 270 per kilo, books—more dangerous and less in demand
than dynamite—if Portuguese and bound, 900 per kilo,
<i>broché</i> 400. Foreign books pay from 100 to 510 per kilo. Books,
however, coming from France, Belgium, or Brazil, are free (the
result being that the Lisbon bookshops are flooded with French
books). Wrought gold pays 120,000 per kilo, wrought silver
35,000 per kilo. Gold and silver coins, says the <i>pauta</i> published
by the <i>Annuario Commercial de Portugal</i>, are free; and one has
to be humbly grateful for such generosity. These Customs
duties provide about one-third of the nation’s revenue. As to
the expenditure it will be found that a large proportion of it
never goes further than Lisbon. When the sums due for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
service of the external and internal debts are subtracted, the
various departments absorb the rest, that is, to a great extent,
the officials of the various departments and the officers of the
army and navy retired or on active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artificial Conditions.</div>

<p>The rates of exchange, moreover, fluctuate more than in any
other country, the value of the pound sterling varying from
4,800 <i>réis</i> to 7,000 or 8,000 <i>réis</i>. And since
not only articles of luxury but a large quantity
of wheat is imported annually, this naturally
has the most serious effect on the life of the whole country.
The imports of Portugal stand to her exports in the proportion
of at least 4 to 3. The whole value of the imports is more
than double that of the exports, but about a third of the
former are re-exported from Lisbon. The Customs (<i>Alfandega</i>)
duties yielded, in round figures, 20,000 <i>contos</i> in 1911, 21,000
<i>contos</i> in 1912, and 23,000 <i>contos</i> in 1913. The Monarchy,
as now the Republic, has been powerless under a system of
artificial finance which has never borne a close relation to the
resources of the country, but lived first on spices from the
colonies, then on gold from Brazil, then on foreign loans,
till the bankruptcy of 1892 rendered even these impossible,
since when it has been compelled to live on issues of paper
money and increase of the floating debt. The Portuguese
Treasury during centuries has closely resembled Gil Vicente’s
poor nobleman, who with a small and dwindling income,
contracted heavy debts and maintained great estate. It was
alleged that the floating debt had sunk to 81,000 <i>contos</i> a few
months after the Revolution of October, 1910, but subsequent
figures disproved the optimism of January, 1911, and in
January, 1914, the floating debt which stood at 82,000 <i>contos</i>
in September, 1910, had advanced to 89,851 <i>contos</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Costa’s Financial Methods.</div>

<p>During his year of office in 1913 as Premier and Finance
Minister, Dr. Affonso Costa’s untiring efforts were directed
towards abolishing the annual deficit. This may seem to many
the very first condition of an improvement in the national
finances, and the object was theoretically excellent. But it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
may be attained by illegitimate means, as unfair taxation or
by postponing necessary payments, and in that case the
deficit will only be abolished at the expense
of a far greater deficit in a few years. It has
always been one of the anomalies of Portuguese
finance that it is possible to have a
full exchequer in a ruined country. To take but one instance,
if the crops in Portugal fail a huge additional amount of
wheat must be imported, and while the peasant is starving the
Exchequer rakes in a surplus in Customs duties. Dr. Costa’s
narrow methods—his great bid for popularity and a surplus—really
increased the artificial character of Portuguese finance,
and its tendency to live from hand to mouth and let the future
take care of itself. It was not only that he made of finance
a party catchword and a source of class-hatred, adopting
Almeida Garrett’s extraordinary maxim that one rich man
means hundreds of poor men (<i>Viagens na minha terra</i>: “<i>Cada
homen rico, abastado, custa centos de infelizes, de miseraveis</i>”),
but that he bent all his ability or energy to the satisfaction
of a personal vanity—to be able to set it on record that his
year was the year of no deficit and—<i>après lui le déluge</i>. The
object should have been rather to encourage wealth in Portugal,
even at a temporary loss to the Exchequer, to give landed
proprietors every incentive to dwell on and develop their
estates rather than to drive them out of the country by a new
property tax, by which they sometimes paid, in this and other
contributions, over a fourth of their income. This tax
(<i>contribuição predial</i>) was successful in immediately raising
revenue, but unfortunately the annual expenditure has also
increased. Dr. Costa estimated it at 78,000 <i>contos</i> for 1914-15,
but in 1909-10 it stood at 74,000. Expenses connected with
the War in 1914 and 1915 have added at least another 40,000
<i>contos</i>, so that Portuguese finances will now be hampered
for many a year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Public Debt.</div>

<p>The whole ambition of Portuguese Finance Ministers is to
make a huge foreign loan, which has been impossible of late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
years, but which the altered circumstances may now enable
them to achieve. The total of the Public Debt is in round
figures, 900,000 <i>contos</i>, the annual interest over
20,000 <i>contos</i>, say twelve shillings per inhabitant.
Since the conversion of the external
debt in 1892 the interest has been faithfully paid. It is
guaranteed by the Customs duties. Whatever improvement
future years may bring to the Portuguese finances will not
come at a bound (reduction in the deficit in five days of 5,000
<i>contos</i>, a surplus of hundreds, a surplus of thousands, the
salvation of the country) but must be very gradual, questions
of finance never being questions of the moment only but
reacting far into the future. It will be the work of scientific
financiers, never of demagogues. He would be a very
unreasonable critic, or a very ignorant party politician,
who should expect the Republic to transform the financial
situation inherited from the Monarchy from a desert
into a garden of roses at the mere wave of a magic wand.
What is expected of any Government worthy of the name is
that it should be a firm and stable Government, that it should
maintain order, promote private initiative and wealth, and
inspire confidence by giving the country not doses of mystification
and paper money, but a straightforward account of
the state of its finances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Colonies.</div>

<p>The country needs to be enlightened, too, as to the advisability
or the reverse of parting with some of her colonies.
With an area in Europe of 35,490 square miles,
Portugal owns more than 800,000. It is an
alarming proportion, although of course that
of the empires of Belgium, Holland and Great Britain are even
greater. But the Portuguese do not seem to possess the
energy and administrative ability needful to leaven the whole
lump of their possessions, in spite of the fact that they adapt
themselves readily to new conditions and to extremes of
climate, and are enterprising in ideas. “As navigators and not
as conquerors, wrote Oliveira Martins” (<i>Historia de Portugal</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
“we unveiled all the secrets of the seas, but our empire
in the East was a disaster both for the East and for us.” Many
of the higher nobility—all that was best in Portugal—were too
proud to engage in trade in the New World. Others went out in
order to amass wealth by whatever means in the shortest
possible time. The colonies were mercilessly exploited by
the mother country. A close system of protection prevented
foreign nations from trading with the Portuguese colonies,
and the Portuguese themselves did little or nothing for the
development of their resources. The unsound administration
in Portugal itself became more so in remote Madeira
and most so in the distant colonies, where more recently the
Governors have been fettered by the strict centralisation of
power in Lisbon and driven to despair by the constant changes
of Government, which seem to make any continuous policy
impossible. As to the condition of the colonies under the
Republic a Republican newspaper—<i>O Seculo</i>—has described
it as a state of anarchy, “an ocean of disorder” (27th February,
1912). “The Portuguese Parliament has given the
natives not justice nor good administration, but—the right
to vote, and this in order that it may be possible to say
grandiloquently that all Portuguese, white or black, have
equal rights in the eyes of the law: To the native of Africa
or Timor, totally ignorant of what is a Parliament or politics,
to the native from whom we have torn his land, whom we
have exploited for centuries, to this native without education
or hospitals or schools or roads, to whom we give nothing, for
whom we do nothing, and from whom we derive no small
profit in the plantations of São Thomé and the mines of the
Rand and in so many other ways. Parliament has granted
not a better justice or more protection or a good administration
adequate to his present state, but the right to vote”
(<i>O Seculo</i>, 20th November, 1912). The same newspaper
declared in a subsequent article that the sale of any part of
the colonies would be a fatal blow to Portuguese nationality,
and a public confession of insolvency “so ardently desired by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
Germany.” The sale of Timor or Macao or Guinea would
only be the thin end of the wedge. This is the view commonly
held in Portugal. Yet Spain, after having looked
askance even at the co-operation of foreign capital in her
colonies—as does Portugal now—has learnt to regret bitterly
that she did not sell Cuba when she had the opportunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Angola.</div>

<p>Exception has been taken even to the decree allowing the
transport of foreign goods through Angola on payment of a
moderate tariff, and as this decree will not
come into force until customs houses have
been built all along the frontier, many
Governments are likely to have risen and fallen in Lisbon
before it ceases to be a dead letter. Meanwhile a
brisk smuggling trade goes on between Angola and the
Belgian Congo. (The duty on cotton goods imported to
Angola is 250 <i>réis</i> per kilo white, 500 <i>réis</i> coloured. Foreign
tobacco pays from 1,800 to 3,600 <i>réis</i> per kilo, and
the duty on other articles amounts to 10, 12, 20, and 25 per
cent. of their value. Foreign imports to Portuguese Congo
pay a smaller duty, for the great majority of articles 6 per
cent. <i>ad valorem</i>.) Angola, with a thousand miles of coast,
is divided into five districts: Congo, Loanda, Benguella,
Mossamedes, and Lunda, and is occupied by 5,000 troops, of
which under 2,000 are Europeans. The total number of
Europeans in the colony is in normal times only about 9,000,
or 2 per cent. of the entire population. The chief exports
are rubber, coffee, wax, etc. It is a fertile land, capable of
immense production when the country can be opened up and
exploited. Of course, the required outlay for this is enormous,
and the Portuguese have not been able to develop their own
European territory, have not the smallest prospect of being
able to develop Angola—a country many times the size of
Portugal—not in the twentieth century. It is sheer waste
to allow this country to remain undeveloped for want of capital
which, chiefly owing to the large potential production
of rubber, would under capable administration, amply repay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
itself. At present the annual deficit in Angola’s budget varies
from 800 to 1,500 <i>contos</i>, and the colony is moreover burdened
by a heavy debt. It is one of the most distressful colonies
of Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mozambique.</div>

<p>The immediate prospects of Mozambique are less distressing,
and recently a slight surplus has been attained, but here, too,
the Hinterland is totally undeveloped. Apart
from the strip of territory along the coast
(1,400 miles in length), says M. Marvaud,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
“l’autorité portugaise ne se fait sentir aux indigènes qu’à
coups d’expéditions militaires.” It yields, among other
products, rubber, cotton and sugar, but it depends largely
for prosperity on the traffic of the port of Lourenço Marques.
This traffic has been secured by the treaty of April, 1909,
between Mozambique and the Transvaal, but is envied by
other African ports, which may succeed in depriving Lourenço
Marques of the traffic in a few years hence, when the treaty
expires. Meanwhile the natives of Mozambique leave the
colony to work in the mines of the Rand, and Mozambique thus
prospers artificially and temporarily, while its own resources
are undeveloped and the means of developing them decrease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese Guinea.</div>

<p>Portuguese Guinea, with about 170,000 inhabitants, yields
much the same products as Mozambique, but its climate is
unhealthy. Much of the trade has been in
the hands of Germany, and, although the soil
is rich the yearly deficit which the Lisbon
Government has to meet for this colony is, with that of Angola,
the principal reason why it has been found impossible to allow
those colonies which have a surplus to keep it for their own use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Thomé and Principe.</div>

<p>Thus, the Budgets of the islands of São Thomé and Principe
show a yearly surplus, but they have not been permitted to
utilise it for the construction of the roads so
greatly needed for their further development.
These islands produce coffee, rubber, tobacco,
ginger, tea, but over 90 per cent. of their exports consists in cocoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Serviçaes.”</div>

<p>As there is insufficient native labour, they are obliged to
import natives from Angola and elsewhere to work on the
plantations. The contracts with the natives
stipulate that they shall be repatriated after
a certain period, but in practice they have
often remained indefinitely in a condition differing from slavery
only in name. (Slavery, in name, was abolished in 1875.)
The Lisbon Government has shown a sincere desire that the
<i>serviçaes</i> should be duly repatriated, but the interests of the
planters have been to obtain native workers where and how
they could, and to retain them permanently.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cape Verde Islands.</div>

<p>Nearer home Portugal possesses the colony of the Cape
Verde Islands, population 150,000.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> They produce maize,
coffee, etc., but suffer from drought. Their
Budget hovers between a small surplus and
a small deficit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Timor.</div>

<p>Of their once mighty empire in the Far East the Portuguese
retain Goa, Diu, Macao, and the western half of the island of
Timor (the Eastern portion being owned by
the Dutch). The administration of the Dutch
compares favourably with that of the Portuguese,
and Timor’s revenue has to be supplemented from the
surplus of Macao—one of the most disheartening features of
Portugal’s colonial system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portugal and her Colonial Empire.</div>

<p>It is true that the Portuguese colonies have made some
progress during the last quarter of a century, and that their
exports to Lisbon tend to increase, but they
are still a drag on Portugal’s energies and
finances. Yet, of course, the Portuguese
have the feeling that if they refuse to part
with any of their overseas dominions and succeed at the cost
of every sacrifice in staving off bankruptcy, and keeping their
colonies together, a time may come two or three centuries
hence when Portugal may once more be a flourishing empire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Perhaps with less centralisation and, consequently, more
continuity in the administration of the colonies a greater
measure of success will be attained. No one will refuse to
pay a tribute to the energy and ability of some Portuguese
colonial Governors. Certainly Great Britain would rejoice
to see these vast regions ably administered and developed
at the hands of her ancient ally. But despite their obstinate
resolution to part with no inch of territory, the Portuguese
have by no means learnt to think imperially; indeed, the
interest in the colonies seems only to flicker into life when there
is thought to be some danger of losing them. And it is clear
that generations must elapse before the most painstaking
and energetic action on their part meets with financial reward.
Many observers have thus come to the conclusion that Portugal
would be well advised to sell a part of her enormous overseas
possessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portugal’s Future.</div>

<p>But against the notion of those who say that Portugal is
dying, slowly dying, it is necessary to enter a strong protest.
If reference is made to Portugal’s future,
“But has Portugal a future?” ask these
sceptics. And the answer is that she has not
only a future but a great future. She is in the fortunate
position of having accomplished great deeds and having
great deeds to accomplish. By no means <i>un peuple qui s’en va</i>.
Rather <i>un peuple qui revient</i>. For, in the sixteenth century,
Portugal may be said to have conquered a whole world and
lost her own soul. The reverse process is now before her:
to begin with Portugal’s own development and prosperity
and so work outwards, and no one will contend that to convert
Portugal from its miserable state into a flourishing and
contented country will not merit all the praises won by
Portugal’s discoveries and conquests of yore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Republicans.</div>

<p>But this prosperity cannot be sudden. Public opinion
abroad, at least, has never asked of the Republicans one half
of what they have constantly given, in words. No one expected
the Portuguese people to become enthusiastic electors after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
a century of indifference to politics, or to cease to be illiterate
at the promulgation of a decree. What is asked of them
is that they should not indulge in continual
disturbances. The majority of Portuguese
Republicans are perhaps rather weak and
vague, but kindly, well-intentioned persons, anxious for peace
and the prosperity of Portugal, and it may be imagined how
mortifying to them have been the criticisms brought upon
the Republic by action of the extremists. These extremists
have to be eliminated before it is possible to work for the
welfare of Portugal, that is, the gradual development of the
Portuguese nation on lines essentially Portuguese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Clerical Question.</div>

<p>With a people so ready to assimilate foreign customs, it is
urgent not to dose it with a French atmosphere, but to encourage
all that is truly national and all too ready
to disappear. Along these lines it should
not be very difficult to find a solution for the
clerical question which has assumed serious proportions since
the Revolution. On the occasion of the third anniversary
of the Law of Separation between Church and State in Portugal,
the Premier, Snr. Bernardino Machado, wrote that it was
“in its essence a law of defence and of social pacification.”
Only if pacification means unrest can these words correspond
with reality. The best way to restore a spirit of quietness
will be to revise carefully the Law of Separation, or, if the
Democrats continue to oppose any such revision, to repeal the
law and enter into a new Concordat between Portugal and the
Vatican.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decentralisation.</div>

<p>The character of the people will have to be consulted, too,
in the question of decentralisation. A sudden change is not
likely to be more beneficial than an imported
anti-clericalism. The divorce between Lisbon
and the provinces will no doubt go lessening
as communications improve. So long as Portugal is in the
grip of a stringently centralised political machine, it is idle
to expect any benefit from passing decrees which entrust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
certain affairs, for instance, construction and repair of roads,
to the municipal authorities, more especially as these decrees
do not always provide any clue as to how the necessary funds
are to be raised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local Autonomy.</div>

<p>But perhaps it would be possible to give the town councils
a provisional autonomy in the matter of primary schools,
sanitation, roads, etc., interesting their vanity
in the result, taking advantage of local
patriotism; or, in cases of signal neglect,
imposing fine or disfranchisement. A decree of the Republic
(dated 4th May, 1911) has attempted something of the sort
for agriculture by imposing an additional tax of five <i>centavos</i>
per <i>hectare</i> on uncultivated land, and the condition that, if
it is still uncultivated in twenty years, it shall become State
property. But that savours perhaps too much of State
interference in private property. At any rate, the advantage
of some such scheme of decentralisation would be that the State
would say to the town councils: “I will give you complete
freedom in these matters, and, far from interfering to a greater
degree, will not interfere at all if you will help yourselves.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the Black List.</div>

<p>A list of towns and villages might be printed at the end of
ten years and posted up throughout the country, or rather
two lists, the second being the black list of
towns or villages which had failed to give any
serious attention to the schools, roads, etc.
These would still be kept under strict supervision, whereas
the others might be allowed complete independence in these
matters, gradually, according to their degree of merit. It
would be a duty of the Civil Governors to visit the towns and
villages in their districts, with the help, when necessary, of
Government inspectors, and it might be possible to include
the quality of bread, the water supply, the cleanliness of hôtels
and inns, tidiness of streets, and a few such subjects in the
inquiry without causing it to degenerate into an inquisition.
One is the more inclined to attribute vast importance for
Portugal’s future to little questions of this kind after reading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
through lengthy decrees, many of the clauses of which are
copied more or less closely from earlier French decrees and are,
in relation to actual conditions in Portugal, of a theoretical,
abstract nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Accursed Politics.”</div>

<p>Politics are, unhappily, becoming more than ever the
burning question at the expense of administration, penetrating
the whole life of the nation, <i>a maldita politica</i>,
as the Portuguese themselves say bitterly.
Perhaps future historians will regard as the
gravest fault of the Republic that it has thus exalted politics
and even saturated education with politics. Perhaps
this is the natural result of a revolution by a minority. The
author of <i>Ethiopia Oriental</i> tells a touching story of how a lion
chased its prey to a river’s bank, where it succeeded in seizing
its hindquarters. A hippopotamus, however, then put in
an appearance, and seized the rest, and in the tug-of-war that
ensued, as Portugal now between her political factions, the
unfortunate animal had a very disagreeable time. But the
country becomes every day more disgusted with politics,
and craves for honest non-political administration. It is
to be hoped that the rotative politics of Lisbon will soon
have had their day, and that with the spread of education the
Portuguese people will awake from its long sleep of torpor
and come into its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Restoration.</div>

<p>Critics of the Republic have to ask themselves what they
have to set in its place. Is the Monarchy, which in October,
1910, melted away like snow in the sun, even
willing to return? The Royalists in Portugal
have amply shown their weakness, and the
active supporters of King Manoel seem to be as few as those
of Dom Miguel. “Active,” since, just as in Spain Carlism
as an active cause is dead but survives in spirit, in Portugal a
spirit that would find greater satisfaction in a Restoration than
in the Republic is widespread. It is especially difficult to
forecast the future of Lisbon politics because in their general
atmosphere of indifference and <i>laissez-aller</i> it is always open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
to a person or group of persons to impose themselves—for
a short period—in a sudden outbreak of energy. It might
not be difficult to restore the Monarchy temporarily by a
sudden <i>coup d’état</i>: the difficulty would be to maintain it.
A restoration brought about by force now would create a very
dangerous and unsatisfactory situation. Not to speak of the
constant danger to which the King would be exposed (and
<i>O Mundo</i>, which has declared that there is as little right to
be a Royalist in Portugal as to be a protector of assassins,
has shown how closely it is in league with assassins by warning
King Manoel that he will be shot like his father if he returns
to Portugal), there would be a perpetual renewal of conspiracies.
The Republicans, far from being crushed, would gain
new adherents by constantly asserting that if they had but
been given a free hand they would have performed wonders
for the people and for Portugal. It is thus essential that the
Republicans should be given a free hand to show what they
can do. This will be seen if they are left in peace by their
opponents till, say, the year 1920. Royalists who have their
cause really at heart will have the wisdom to wait and not
injure it, perhaps fatally, by foolish and precipitate action.
The Royalists sometimes say that the Republic has manifestly
failed because it has increased the tendency to disorder and
indiscipline, and rendered the financial situation more critical;
but it would perhaps be fairer to say that it will have manifestly
failed should the next period of five or six years resemble
the first, since three or four years is not a very long period by
which to form a definite opinion of a new <i>régime</i> after a
revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Republica Radical.”</div>

<p>But, judging from the past, no one can be very optimistic.
A considerable number of Republicans at Lisbon desire a more
radical Republic. The stages are to be from
The Monarchy to Republic, and from <i>bourgeois</i>
Republic to Socialist Republic, or the
<i>Republica Radical</i>. It was in the same sense
that Don Pablo Iglesias, leader of the Spanish Socialists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
prophesied in 1910 that the Portuguese Republic would
not long be content to remain of the <i>bourgeois</i> type.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manual Labour.</div>

<p>A Republic of workmen, in which all who did not spend at
least five hours a day in manual labour would be disfranchised,
would be a delightful experiment. A Republic
of principles so excellent would not, however,
suit the character of the Portuguese very well—a
people that still looks askance at manual labour as
illiberal, even to the carrying of a parcel in the street, and loves
the liberal professions and idleness-with-a-sense-of-importance.
Yet if Portugal wishes to be really revolutionary she would
adopt this programme of manual labour (with alternative of
military service) for all under sixty years of age from Minister
to miner, from President to ploughman, the only sure remedy
for a great many modern social problems. And there are other
revolutionary methods by which Portugal in the twentieth
century might prove herself original and win the admiration of
Europe, for instance by ordaining that women who do a man’s
work should receive a man’s wages, or by teaching the people to
depend on themselves and not on the State, or by abolishing
the whole system of party politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abolition of Party Politics.</div>

<p>Hitherto her revolutions have only increased the domain of
politics, and each party in turn beseeches the country to look
to it exclusively with mouth agape for the
fruit to drop in. Yet it becomes increasingly
evident that the only problem for all Portuguese
who love their country is the rooting
out of that kind of party politics which has infested and ruined
the country for three-quarters of a century. The remedy is
for all such true patriots to club together and found a party
and a Press which will have nothing to say to clericalism and
anti-clericalism and other such questions, never for a moment
discuss them—what have they to do with the government
of a State?—will not concern itself with personal ambitions,
merely looking upon the State as a public department of police
and civil servants, implying hard work, and pay far less than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
would be earned by men of similar intelligence devoted to
industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work for Patriots.</div>

<p>Above all, such a party would encourage the people to expect
nothing from the State and everything from themselves.
It would thus begin with the individual and
teach him to cultivate his own garden, a
lesson enormously needed in a country so
inclined to vague ideals and actual <i>desleixo</i>. In its Press and
in public speeches throughout the countries it would show by
concrete facts and figures the immeasurable good achieved
in certain districts by a single landowner living on his land
and looking after his tenants and estate, or a single priest
looking after his parish and leaving politics to look after
themselves, or even on a smaller scale by a single peasant
family with a knowledge of cleanliness and good cooking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Portuguese Party.</div>

<p>These real patriots would be so undignified politicians
that they would not in their speeches mention a single “ism,”
but they would tell the people what one
village had gained in health by a good sanitation,
what another had gained in wealth
by having roads well built and well repaired. They would
not inveigh against the Capitalist or the Conservative or the
Anarchist, but they would attack and, if possible, bring to
book those who palm off on the people sandals made of
blotting-paper and bread made of sawdust. In a word,
they would be concerned with the concrete, leaving abstract
problems for philosophers of the study. And since most other
parties are engaged in importing high-sounding programmes
from abroad, this new party might well call itself the Portuguese
Party, and its newspaper the Portuguese People. The
peasants of Portugal, witty, intelligent, eager to learn, will
respond to words that mean something to their daily lives,
and are not merely pompous polysyllables and the beating of
the big political drum. The future of Portugal lies with them,
and the party which succeeds in improving the people’s health
in body and soul will have paved the way for better times.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
In this, indeed, all parties are agreed, but their favourite
method is to make a great sound and fury of words, and to
promise the people that if it will but follow that party only
some decree will be passed which, before the new moon, will
have changed them from black to white, from lean kine into
fat kine. Yet a party which really had the people’s interests
at heart would go to work much more gradually, not through
the abstract People but through the individual and the
family, and would make it clear that the people had nothing
to expect of the party, and the party asked nothing of the
people. By such obvious sincerity the people would be
brought to listen to this party, and to learn to live their own
lives—each family its life in health and independence. How
far removed this creed from Liberty, Humanity, and other
such stereotyped catchwords, yet how infinitely more
conducive to a prosperous future for Portugal!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conciliatory Methods.</div>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated that such strident questions
as anti-clericalism are to a great extent factitious in Portugal,
and not of natural growth. The more conciliatory
and apparently weaker policy of
Dr. Arriaga, the President, and Snr. Antonio
José de Almeida, has really been less far removed from the
realities of Portuguese life than the policy of Dr. Affonso Costa,
who is considered the clever practical politician among his
more idealist colleagues. The more tolerant attitude towards
priests and Royalists has proved to be not only the kindlier but
the wiser policy. This attitude became a fact in the hands of
General Pimenta de Castro. His wise and moderate government
made it more doubtful than ever if Portugal, which gained
nothing by one revolution, would be the gainer by a second.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Royalists.</div>

<p>The Restoration must be peaceful and gradual if it is to be
permanently successful. The extreme usefulness to the
Republic of Royalist conspiracies has been
fully recognised by the “White Ants” and
<i>Carbonarios</i>, and the Royalists themselves
are now convinced that it is not by incursion or conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
that they will advance their interests. They realise that
without any such methods Royalism is likely to gain strength,
has indeed already done so. No doubt many distrust the
idea of the accession of Dom Miguel because of the reactionary
traditions of the Miguelist party, a distrust antiquated but
not unnatural. On the other hand, the Manuelist cause is
weak because King Manoel, being then in his teens and
brought suddenly to the throne by the murder of his father
and brother, had not time to show that he possessed the qualities
of a strong ruler. Strangely enough, some Portuguese
who profess and call themselves Portuguese, have no hesitation
in saying that the best solution would be a foreign prince,
English or Italian, imposed by foreign intervention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Longing for Peace and Stability.</div>

<p>The real inference is that they desire above all things a
strong and stable Government, and are heartily tired of a
state of affairs which seems to make a continuity
of policy or any long period of order
and quiet alike impossible. A Restoration
in a few years’ time may best secure such
continuity, and if there is a single fair and practical reform
opposed by the Royalists the Republicans will do well to
name it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monarchy and Empire.</div>

<p>Not that a Restoration need be considered of any very
great importance: if the moderate Republicans can provide
a stable Government sensible Royalists would
no doubt cease from all opposition to the
Republic. But, of course, a Monarchy is in
accordance with the old traditions of Portugal, and has value
with regard to the colonial empire, in which unrest has
increased, and very naturally, since the Revolution: the natives
more readily yield obeisance to a king than to an abstraction.
And there would be no danger of the Royalists setting themselves
to persecute in their turn after a Restoration, since they
are well aware how great would be the outcry throughout
Europe. A few political careers, certainly, would be cut short,
but perhaps the country would not be greatly the loser. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Monarchy has value, too, in international relations, and the
Republicans do not attach sufficient importance, for instance,
to King Carlos’ foreign visits and to the visits of foreign
princes to Lisbon during his reign. They class them among the
extravagances of the Monarchy. These advantages will
probably be thrown into even greater relief by another five
years of Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Labels.</div>

<p>If the adversaries of the Republic will but refrain from all
movement of rebellion or incursion, the next five years will
show with sufficient clearness whether the
permanent tranquillity ardently desired by
the Portuguese people is to be labelled
Monarchy or Republic. It is after all little more than a label
(the label “Monarchy” being more useful in an Empire);
the <i>thing</i> required is a Government willing and able to employ
the services of all Portuguese in the work of making Portugal
once more great and prosperous, to give free scope to individual
energies under a <i>régime</i> of true liberty and toleration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trifles.</div>

<p>It has been the folly of the Republicans not to yield on small,
unessential questions. They have laid stress on such secondary
matters as the new flag (the loud and
ugly colours of which will never be readily
accepted by the Portuguese nation, or so
affirm those who know the Portuguese intimately), on the
alteration of names of streets and squares throughout the
country. They have made a parade of much legislation. A
new heaven and a new earth. Yet it would have been a
wiser policy on their part not to make so much of these little
harassing novelties, but more quietly to work at necessary
essential changes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Internal Floating Debt.</div>

<p>A writer in 1908 remarked that “If only the Government
could cease to have recourse to the floating debt agriculture
in Portugal would be able to obtain the cheap
capital which it needs.” But the Republic
has added thousands of <i>contos</i> yearly to the
internal floating debt, and capital has greater inducement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
than ever to flee from agriculture in order to provide State
loans. Here a radical change was required. Nor will Dr.
Costa’s property-tax benefit agriculture. It is more likely
to increase emigration. The docile peasants of Portugal,
if they find the conditions of their life becoming harder and
more precarious, do not think of protesting. A few conflicts
have occurred between peasants and the Republican Guard,
and the villagers have armed themselves with scythes and
pitchforks to protect their churches in the North. But
mostly they emigrate, leaving the political parties at Lisbon
to devise and squabble over intricate and theoretical measures
of legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Facts of Twofold Import.</div>

<p>But there is a reverse and more promising side to all this.
That Lisbon politics are Lisbon politics, and are not genuinely
Portuguese politics, but a foreign froth on the
surface of the sleeping nation, that the majority
of Portuguese cannot read or write, that
many of those who can read and write are
perfectly indifferent to politics, are all facts of twofold import,
since, however deplorable in themselves, they imply that
the Portuguese people has not yet had fair trial, and that it
may well have a future before it. The character of the peasants
outside the immediate influence of Lisbon has many
sterling qualities. The problem consists in educating them
without depriving them of their qualities, in civilisation
without the demoralising effect of great cities; and indeed
in the coming age of rapid communications city life will no
doubt be largely a thing of the past. The educated Portuguese
of Lisbon, far gone in introspective analysis and pessimism,
is inclined readily to believe that the Portuguese are
a dying and decadent race; but the truer view is that the
Portuguese nation is still unborn. It may make its mark on
history in future centuries as a few individual Portuguese
did in the fifteenth and sixteenth. The future of the nation
is, perhaps fortunately, not bound up with that of the Democrats,
as the Democrats would have us believe, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Portuguese nation with a future is precisely all that part of the
population which has remained indifferent to the Republican
creed, and has not been affected by Republican promises.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A STUDY IN COSTUMES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">Natural Reaction.</div>

<p>It appears even that the educated youth (as at Coimbra), in
a natural reaction, is now more inclined to turn to religious
and other serious questions than it was a
generation ago, and it is thus doubtful whether
the Republic will be able to renovate itself
and whether new politicians will come forward to take the
place of the three or four now in evidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Un Petit Moyen.”</div>

<p>Talleyrand would say in a serious political crisis that there
was still “un petit moyen,” meaning Talleyrand. Under
the Portuguese Republic the “petit moyen”
in exactly the same way has been Dr. Affonso
Costa, who has Talleyrand’s presumption
although he lacks his ability. Dr. Almeida and Dr. Camacho
have never had the strength to take office, nor the good sense
permanently to unite their parties. But since Dr. Costa
has not the will or has not the courage or has not the power
to do without, and indeed to crush Snr. França Borges and his
<i>Mundo</i>, and the <i>Carbonario</i> satellites organised by the Democrat
party since the Revolution, the outlook for the Republic
is not very promising.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lisbon Republic.</div>

<p>The Republicans have become a shrinking circle. At
Oporto, where the Republicans were always few, they have
not increased since 1910. This is admitted
sincere Republicans. For instance, <i>A
Republica</i> of 7th March, 1914: “Oporto is
not sensibly more Republican to-day than it was on the
5th of October, 1910. The Republican party then at
Oporto was so plainly in a minority that it was unable
even to win the municipal elections.” Able men such as
Dr. Duarte Leite and Snr. Bazilio Telles tend more and
more to hold aloof from politics. Only at Lisbon a great
part, probably the larger half of the inhabitants, in quantity
if not in quality, is enthusiastically Republican. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
likely to remain so for several years. The Lisbon shopkeepers
have accepted with all the simple want of faith of the
half-educated the assertion that all the evils of Portugal came
from religion and the Jesuits. For the present they are kept
in expectation of the golden age that was to follow the expulsion
of the religious orders by a multitude of projects. Every
day <i>O Seculo</i>, the most widely-read Republican newspaper,
appears with some new proposition, the reorganisation of the
Army, the construction of a fleet, the acquisition of aeroplanes,
the extension of railways, roads, a bridge across the Tagus,
and so forth. Of course nothing is done, but the illusion of
a new age is maintained. If in a few more years it is seen that
nothing of all this has been accomplished, that deficits continue,
and taxes increase, probably the Lisbon world of
industry and commerce will reconsider its political opinions.
There have been too many projects and too much self-analysis
at Lisbon. It may be seen from the quotations given in this
book that the Portuguese Republic has had a few bitter and
outspoken critics in its midst.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impunity for Outrages.</div>

<p>The difficulty has been to translate their words into action.
They have called for the punishment of the authors of various
outrages, but have succeeded at the most in
bringing about—an additional outrage. Thus,
when Snr. Pimenta, a member of the Evolutionist
party, placed on his programme at a recent election the
punishment of the delators and of the promoters of public
disorder, he was set upon at Barreiro for his pains, and had
some difficulty in escaping from the mob. And the same class
of scoundrels who wrecked the offices of all the Royalist
newspapers at Lisbon and in the provinces, are waiting to
return to their nefarious practices should occasion offer. But
indeed if the moderate Republicans realise that by every
feigned indifference, every timid acquiescence in the excesses
of the minority, they are driving a nail into the coffin of
Portugal, or at least into the coffin of the Republic, they will
have the courage to unite in restraining the actions of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
minority, not only for a few months, but for ever, and they
will find that the country is on their side. So far the Portuguese
might paraphrase the words of Thiers, and say that
“the Republic is the form of government which divides
us <i>most</i>.” The one idea of saving the State or improving the
situation is to split up into more parties, to initiate a new
movement, to form a new group of defence, a band of spies
and delators, such as the “White Ants,” or a party of vague
idealists. But the nation will become more and more convinced
that the road to prosperity does not lie through politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“A Tolerant Progressive Republic.”</div>

<p>“A violent change of Government at present,” wrote
<i>O Socialista</i> (14th July, 1913), (now <i>A Vanguarda</i>, organ of
the Socialists), “may be welcomed by those
honest Republicans and sincere patriots who
desire a modern, tolerant, progressive Republic,
and a period of tranquillity and
careful work for their country.” A modern, tolerant, progressive
Government would unite all but the merest handful
of extremists in the common cause of Portugal. Only it is
necessary to emphasise the fact that the Government must not
be tolerant of crimes and indiscipline, since this appears to
have been constantly overlooked by Republican Governments.
The punishment of one crime will save many. It is extremely
improbable that the second and far worse Gymnasio Theatre
outrage would have occurred had the authors of the first been
punished. But low as the Republic has sunk by thus winking
at these iniquities, it is not too late for it to consolidate and
retrieve itself because the longing for peace and tranquillity
is so prevalent in the country, and the fear of another political
upheaval so great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Docility of the People.</div>

<p>If the Republic proved itself not necessarily a very able
or a very original or a very attractive <i>régime</i>, but merely
fair and conciliatory, it could win over all
the quiet, docile inhabitants of Portugal,
that is, over 90 per cent. of the population.
Portugal should not be a difficult country to govern if it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
once made clear that those who get out of hand and go from
words (which no wise ruler in Portugal would ever attempt to
check) to deeds, will be exemplarily punished. Docility is
the rule, and acquiescence, so long as the acquiescent are
allowed the right of perpetual sarcasm and ridicule, which
are, indeed, the safety-valve of Portuguese politics. The
occasional movements of a more serious nature might be
curbed more efficaciously by shooting one or two ringleaders
than by imprisoning hundreds of men for months and then
trying and acquitting them. They leave the prisons with a
sense of injustice suffered and are henceforth confirmed
enemies of the Government. But the Democrat Republicans
have shown the strangest determination to turn the indifferent
into enemies and to alienate friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New Inquisition.</div>

<p>There is scarcely a politician or newspaper outside the Democrat
party which has not been attacked and insulted. Under
the searching action of this party the Republic
been in danger of being limited to a few
thousands, of convinced Democrats and
ardent Republicans no doubt, but a few isolated thousands.
And so inquisitorial have been their methods that they have
in fact a right to consider themselves lineal descendants of the
Portuguese Inquisition, which so vigilantly sought out and
punished “new Christians” and heretics. They are thus
disciples of the very body of men whom they least admire,
but extremes meet. (The pity is that the extremists meet
also, as the streets of Lisbon have reason to remember.) They
have been in too great a hurry. Fresh adherents to the
Republic can only come gradually if they come at all. And
gradually must come the benefits, if any, that the Republic
is to confer upon Portugal. The evils are four hundred years
old, and it is absurd to attribute them to Dom Luiz
or Dom Carlos, or Snr. João Franco; and still more absurd
to pretend to end them by drawing up a hundred or so
new laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confused Rhetoric.</div>

<p>The work of the Provisional Government was “gigantic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
marvellous, superb,” declared the Republican deputy, Snr.
Alexandre Braga. “Never again,” he said in a dithyrambic
speech, typical of the muddy thinking of the day, “never again
will the family in Portugal return to the state
demoralising hypocrisy to which it was
nailed by the rigid dogma that forbade
divorce. Never again will woman’s dignity be bespattered
by lies and disloyalty and treachery through having to hide
as a disgrace the pure flame of her true love [<i>i.e.</i>, for some one
not her husband]. Never again will the children be poisoned
by the lethal infiltration of a Jesuit education. No more
cloisters, no more superstition, no more showy and mercenary
charity....”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discipline.</div>

<p>Yet it was more not less discipline that Portuguese society
required. Fatal to Portugal is likely to prove the policy
which seeks deliberately to undermine all
authority—of the family (by new facilities
given to divorce); of the priest (by instituting
public worship societies); of the landowner (by taxing him
to a fourth or more of his income), of the Army (by subjecting
it to the <i>Carbonarios</i>), of the police (by encouraging “White
Ants” and mob to take the law into their own hands), of
justice (by dismissing and banishing those judges who refuse
to be influenced by politics), of the law (by shaping it entirely
to party ends).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Constitution.</div>

<p>Some clauses of the present Constitution are excellent, but
they are dead letters. In Chapter II (concerning the rights
and guarantees of individuals), for instance,
clause 4 decrees that “Liberty of conscience
and belief is inviolable.” So “No one can
be persecuted on the ground of religion” (clause 6); “Expression
of thought in whatever form is completely free, without
previous censure” (clause 13; but, proceeds this clause,
the abuse of this right is liable to punishment); “The right
of meeting and association is free” (clause 14); “The
inviolability of private houses is guaranteed” (clause 15);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
“No one can be arrested without a warrant” (clause 18);
“The secrecy of the post is inviolable” (clause 28); “Citizens
may resist any order which infringes the guarantees of the
individual, unless these guarantees have been suspended by
law” (clause 37). It is certainly time to put these excellent
precepts into practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tyranny of a Minority.</div>

<p>“<i>Paz ponen los omes entre si á las vezes</i>,” said King Alfonso X
some seven centuries ago: “men sometimes make peace with
one another”; and this is still occasionally
the case. There is no reason why all moderate
and patriotic Portuguese should not unite
to eliminate the extremists. It ill befits
Portugal’s dignity that a body of some six thousand should
tyrannize over a population of six millions. There is scope
for the activities of all Portuguese, room for the interests of
all, in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreigners and Portugal.</div>

<p>But so long as this small minority dominates and systematically
stifles the voice of the majority of the Portuguese and
gags the Portuguese Press, foreign criticism
will be legitimate and necessary. The Democrats
constantly misrepresent all such criticism
as hostility towards Portugal (instead of hostility towards
the <i>Carbonarios</i> and Democrats), a misrepresentation which
excites much amusement among those who know that nine-tenths
of the inhabitants of Portugal detest and fear their
despotism. Foreign critics must be few and ignorant indeed
who are animated by dislike of Portugal or the Portuguese.
Most foreigners after a sojourn in Portugal take away the most
pleasant impressions of the land and people, and they deplore
the fact that it should be possible to say of Portugal, as was
once said of Spain, that it has been given every blessing except
that of a good Government. Rich in its sea and soil, and
subsoil and climate, rich in buildings, traditions and literature
from a glorious past, fortunate in the intelligent and progressive
character of the inhabitants, Portugal possesses
splendid advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Individual Enterprise.</div>

<p>That these advantages should be turned to account depends
rather on the individual energy and enterprise of every Portuguese
than on politics. All that should be
desired of the Government is that it should
afford a fair and open field for individual
effort. And every Portuguese who lives not in Paris but in
Portugal, who devotes himself to hard work instead of some
so-called liberal profession, and who in his own immediate
sphere of action encourages among the peasants cleanliness
and regard for health, and among the educated toleration and
discipline, will do more for Portugal than all the wordy warfare
of the party politicians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign Importations.</div>

<p>Gil Vicente, four centuries ago, implored his countrymen “not
to be Genoese but very Portuguese,” and, if the Portuguese
wish to renew that respect in which, on account
of their past history, they are still held abroad,
they will make Portugal not less but more
Portuguese. And since all the troubles of Portugal during
the last hundred years have come from foreign importations,
of language, literature, politics, habits, imperfectly adapted
to the requirements, customs, and character of Portugal,
there are a hundred ways in which this can be done, as for
instance, by purifying the language from Gallicisms and
empty pomposities (a Lisbon political party has recently
declared its programme to be <i>procurar effectivar uma politica
de realizações</i>: the gorgeous sound of it stuns an audience,
but the words are really as empty as a pod that rattles in the
wind after shedding all its seeds); by encouraging regional
literature; by living the Portuguese country life which formed
a delightful feature in Portugal before the foreign conquests
of the sixteenth century drew all men to Lisbon. Even the
importation of foreign capital has been a doubtful gain, and
has either been squandered with small result or been applied
by foreigners. “Our principal railway company is foreign,
our electric trams foreign, the gas company is largely constituted
by foreign capital, our chief exports, as those of cork,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
preserves, wine of Oporto and Madeira, copper, etc., are in the
hands of foreigners, a great part of our external commerce and
transports is carried on by foreigners” (<i>O Seculo</i>, 13th November,
1911). And, worst of all, the political programmes are
foreign. Foreigners may be inclined to smile when they see
foreign customs and institutions (as the English parliamentary
system) distorted and misapplied in Portugal, but for all that
is genuinely Portuguese they can have nothing but admiration
and respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local Influence.</div>

<p>With a population so docile and ready to learn, above all so
inclined to prefer some distant uncertainty to the reality
before them, it is all-important to have a
strong non-political influence in each parish,
whether that influence be of priest or professor,
doctor or landowner. Without some such nucleus more
and more will vagueness and bewilderment drive the peasant
in a stream of emigration to Lisbon and Brazil, and Portugal
become denationalised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scope for all Portuguese.</div>

<p>That “violent change” advocated by <i>A Vanguarda</i> in
1913 was brought about two years later by the movement,
without violence, which brought General
Pimenta de Castro into power. Snr. Manoel
de Arriaga and General Pimenta de Castro
deserve the lasting gratitude of their country for having
attempted to provide the first indispensable conditions for
all those who wish to work for the good of Portugal. A
Government of this kind, impartial, conciliatory, and firm,
offered to every Portuguese without exception—even Snr.
Paiva Conceiro, the leader of the Royalist incursions of 1911
and 1912, was allowed to return—an opportunity to lay
politics aside and unite to raise Portugal from her present
misery. Every sincere Portuguese will admit that there is
much work ready to his hand which has little to say to politics,
if it be only the development of an acre of land or the reconciliation
between two rival points of view. And another sign
of good omen is the more serious outlook on life of the younger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
generation and the existence of a new party—that of the
Integralists—which is inclined to set to work obscurely,
gradually, unconventionally, with a view to the actual needs
of the people, of the professional working man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Conquests.</div>

<p>Every great—or small—landowner who takes a personal
interest in his property, every non-political politician—the
phrase is no contradiction in terms—who
studies not rhetoric but reality, every Portuguese,
however humble, who cultivates his
own garden, whether that garden be the Portuguese language
or literature or soil or subsoil or industry, will go a step
towards constituting a real Portugal of the Portuguese, and
will deserve as many laurels of his country as crown the brows
of the old <i>Conquistadores</i>.</p>

Republic comes of an ancient family and has a Basque name (“the
place of stones,” or “a heap of stones,” <i>arri</i> being probably the same
word as in Biarritz: two rocks). He was born at Horta on the 8th
of July, 1840, and studied at Coimbra. For some years he was
professor of English at the Lisbon <i>Lycée</i>. He was elected deputy
for Madeira. Besides some well-known volumes of poems it
may be noted that he published in 1889 an essay condemning
the penitentiary system. Although Dr. Arriaga has never, during the
last forty years or more, swerved from his Republican principles, he
has done his utmost as President to moderate the action of the extremists,

are universally felt towards himself.</p>
